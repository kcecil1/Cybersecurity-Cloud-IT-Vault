#### **Why These Labs?**

1. **Network Reconnaissance:** Labs like exploring device information, detecting open ports, and using tools like Wireshark help understand and analyze the network environment.
2. **Access Control:** Labs related to ACLs, password protection, and port security focus on controlling access to devices and networks.
3. **Switch Security:** Configuring VLANs and securing switches is vital for understanding how networks segment and secure traffic.
4. **Wireless Security:** Many attacks target wireless networks, making these labs essential for identifying vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi configurations.
5. **Cryptography:** Basic cryptography labs like hashing provide foundational knowledge for understanding encrypted communications.
6. **Hands-On Security Tools:** Labs using Nmap, Wireshark, and SMAC directly relate to real-world penetration testing tools.

#### **Conclusion**

Focus on **Network Security (14.0)**, **Access Control Lists (12.0)**, and **Switch Security (11.0)** first, as they offer the most practical penetration testing knowledge. From there, expand into **Wireless Networks (9.0)** and **Cryptography (15.0)**. This selection provides a solid foundation to transition into penetration testing effectively.
