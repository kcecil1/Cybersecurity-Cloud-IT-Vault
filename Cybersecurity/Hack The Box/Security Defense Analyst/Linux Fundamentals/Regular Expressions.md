Let's make learning Regular Expressions (RegEx) fun and ADHD-friendly with a story-like approach! Imagine you're a **digital detective**, on a mission to solve different text-based puzzles. Each task has a unique pattern you're trying to uncover, just like finding clues in a detective case. Every pattern is part of a bigger puzzle that will make you a master of searching for patterns in files.

**Your Detective Toolbox:**
- **Grep:** It's like your magnifying glass—helps you zoom in on exactly what you’re looking for.
- **Metacharacters:** These are your detective tools—special symbols that help narrow down the search.

### Quick warm-up practice:  
You can play with these commands directly in your terminal by practicing on files like `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

### Task 1: Grouping Patterns – **Finding the Hidden Clue**
Think of grouping patterns in RegEx like grouping pieces of a puzzle. 

1. **Round Brackets ( )**: It's like grouping clues together that should be matched as a whole.  
   Example: Search for all lines that contain either “my” or “false.”
   - Run this: 
     ```bash
     grep -E "(my|false)" /etc/passwd
     ```
   You’ll see lines that match **either** "my" or "false" show up, like a detective scanning documents for keywords.

2. **Square Brackets [ ]**: This helps you find a set of specific characters. It’s like looking for any letter or number within a group.  
   Example: Search for lowercase letters a through z.
   - Play with this:
     ```bash
     grep -E "[a-z]" /etc/passwd
     ```
   Every time a lowercase letter appears, it's like discovering a hidden code in your document.

3. **Curly Brackets { }**: Curly brackets define how often a pattern repeats. Imagine you’re counting the number of times a clue appears in your documents.  
   Example: Search for any word that appears exactly 5 times.
   - Try this:
     ```bash
     grep -E "a{5}" /etc/passwd
     ```
   You’re searching for lines where a character appears 5 times in a row, like finding recurring symbols on a treasure map.

4. **OR Operator (|)**: This is your go-to tool when you're looking for either one thing **or** another.  
   Example: Find lines with either "permit" or "authentication."
   - Try this:
     ```bash
     grep -E "(Permit|Authentication)" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     ```

5. **AND Operator (.*)**: Here, you’re searching for both patterns in the same line.
   Example: Find lines that contain both "my" and "false."
   - Run this:
     ```bash
     grep -E "(my.*false)" /etc/passwd
     ```

### Puzzle-solving practice with files:
To help you practice, let's work on a few cases. Imagine you’re solving a riddle in a cyber mystery book!

**Case 1:** Show all lines that don’t contain the # character.  
This is like searching for hidden secrets that aren’t commented out.
```bash
grep -v "#" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

**Case 2:** Find all lines with words starting with "Permit".  
You’re looking for lines where permissions are granted. 
```bash
grep "^Permit" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

**Case 3:** Find all lines with words ending in "Authentication."  
Time to crack security-related lines!
```bash
grep "Authentication$" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

**Case 4:** Search for all lines containing the word "Key."  
Like finding the key to unlock the door!
```bash
grep "Key" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

**Case 5:** Find lines that start with "Password" and contain "yes."  
A password unlocks access, and "yes" is the key.
```bash
grep "^Password.*yes" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

**Case 6:** Show all lines that end with "yes."  
It’s like finding the final piece of the puzzle—confirming something with a "yes."
```bash
grep "yes$" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

**Pro-tip for Quick Practice:**  
Turn this into a mini-game. Set a timer and see how fast you can find the patterns using grep! Each successful command is like cracking a code to solve a mystery!

Enjoy being the detective on your quest to mastering RegEx! Feel free to practice these commands one at a time, and let me know how it goes!
