Here’s a fun and ADHD-friendly guide to **using AND, OR, and NOT in SQL**!

---

### **🎯 Logical Operators: AND, OR, and NOT - The Dream Team!**

These operators are like the **superheroes** of SQL! They help you **filter** data with **precision** to get exactly what you need. Let’s break them down!

---

### **🍏 AND Operator: The “Both Must Be True” Rule**

- **AND** connects **two conditions** that **both** need to be true.  
  - **Example:** You want customers **handled by support rep #5 AND located in the USA**.

In SQL, it’s like saying:  
"Show me customers with **supportrepid = 5 AND country = 'USA'**."

```
SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country, supportrepid
FROM customers
WHERE supportrepid = 5 AND country = 'USA';
```

This will give you all customers who meet **both** conditions—handled by **rep 5** AND in the **USA**.

---

### **🌀 OR Operator: The “One or Both” Rule**

- **OR** says that **either** one or the **other** condition (or both) can be true.  
  - **Example:** You want customers in **either the USA or Canada** to send a security update.

In SQL, it’s like saying:  
"Show me customers where **country = 'Canada' OR country = 'USA'**."

```
SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'Canada' OR country = 'USA';
```

This will return customers in **either** country—USA or Canada (or both!).

---

### **🚫 NOT Operator: The “Opposite Day” Rule**

- **NOT** flips the condition—it finds **everything that doesn’t** meet the rule.  
  - **Example:** You want to find all customers **not in the USA**.

In SQL, it’s like saying:  
"Show me customers where the **country is NOT USA**."

```
SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
FROM customers
WHERE NOT country = 'USA';
```

This will return **every customer** who is **not** from the USA.

---

### **💡 Pro Tip: You Can Also Use <> or !=**

Instead of using **NOT**, you can also use **<>** or **!=** to say “**not equal to**.”

- **Example:**

```
WHERE country <> 'USA';
```

is the same as:

```
WHERE NOT country = 'USA';
```

---

### **🧠 Combining Logical Operators: The Power Combo!**

You can combine these logical operators to create **super filters**.

- **Example:** If you need to find all customers **not in Canada AND not in the USA** (to avoid sending updates to these two countries):

```
SELECT firstname, lastname, email, country
FROM customers
WHERE NOT country = 'Canada' AND NOT country = 'USA';
```

This returns customers in **every other country** except for the USA and Canada.

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways:**

- **AND** = Both conditions must be true.  
  - **Example:** Customers with rep #5 **AND** in the USA.
  
- **OR** = Either or both conditions can be true.  
  - **Example:** Customers in the **USA OR Canada**.
  
- **NOT** = Exclude something.  
  - **Example:** Customers **NOT in the USA**.

- **Pro Tip:** You can use **<>** or **!=** instead of **NOT** for the same effect.

With **AND, OR, and NOT**, you can get super specific with your SQL queries, finding just the right data! 🕵️‍♂️ Ready to start combining these operators like a SQL ninja? 🎉
