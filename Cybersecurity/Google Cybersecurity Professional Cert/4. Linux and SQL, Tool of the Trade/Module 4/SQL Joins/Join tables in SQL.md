Here’s a fun and ADHD-friendly breakdown of **joining tables in SQL**!

### **🧩 Joining Tables: Combining Powers!**

Imagine you’ve got two puzzle pieces, and they fit perfectly together. That’s what **joining tables** does in SQL! You can combine info from two different tables to get a complete picture—like finding out which machines are vulnerable based on their operating system. Cool, right?

---

### **🔗 How to Join Tables: The Basics**

SQL needs to know **which column** connects the two tables, and we tell it exactly where to look using a **join**.

1. If you have a column like **employee_id** in both the **employees** and **machines** tables, you need to tell SQL **which** employee_id you’re talking about.
2. Use this format:  
   `table_name.column_name`
   - **Example:** `employees.employee_id` or `machines.employee_id`.

---

### **💡 Primary Key vs. Foreign Key**

- **Primary Key**: A column with **unique** values in each row (like a special ID).
  - **Example:** `employee_id` in the **employees** table.
  
- **Foreign Key**: A column that **links** to a primary key from another table.
  - **Example:** `employee_id` in the **machines** table.

### **🔀 INNER JOIN: Matching Rows Only!**

An **INNER JOIN** gives you rows that match between two tables based on a **common column**. If there’s no match, it won’t include those rows.

- **Example:** Join the **employees** and **machines** tables to see which employees are using which machines:

```
SELECT username, office, operating_system
FROM employees
INNER JOIN machines
ON employees.employee_id = machines.employee_id;
```

- This query finds matching **employee_id** values in both tables and gives you the **username, office, and operating system** for those matches!

---

### **📝 Breaking Down the INNER JOIN Query**

- **INNER JOIN**: Tells SQL to match rows between two tables.
- **employees**: The first (or left) table.
- **machines**: The second (or right) table.
- **ON employees.employee_id = machines.employee_id**: This is how you tell SQL to match the two tables based on the **employee_id** column.

---

### **🤔 What About NULL Values?**

**NULL** means missing data. For example, some machines might not be assigned to any employee, so the **employee_id** is missing. In an **INNER JOIN**, those rows won’t show up because they don’t have a match.

---

### **💥 What Did We Just Do?**

- We **joined** the **employees** and **machines** tables to get a combined list of who’s using which machine.
- We used an **INNER JOIN** to match rows where the **employee_id** exists in both tables.
- SQL only gave us the columns we **selected**—**username, office, and operating system**.

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways:**

- **INNER JOIN** only gives you rows that **match** between two tables.
- You need to specify **which columns** to match on, like `employee_id`.
- If there’s no match (NULL), the row won’t show up in the result.
