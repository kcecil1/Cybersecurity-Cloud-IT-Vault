# Intro to the shell

Welcome back! In this video, we're going to discuss the Linux shell.&#x20;

This part of the Linux architecture is where the action will happen for&#x20;

you as a security analyst.&#x20;

We introduced the shell with other components of the Linux OS earlier,&#x20;

but let's take a deeper look at what the shell is and what it does.

The shell is the command-line interpreter.&#x20;

That means it helps you communicate with the operating system through&#x20;

the command line.&#x20;

Previously, we discussed a command-line interface.&#x20;

This is essentially the shell.&#x20;

The shell provides the command-line interface for you to interact with the OS.&#x20;

To tell the OS what to do, you enter commands into this interface.&#x20;

A command is an instruction telling the computer to do something.&#x20;

The shell communicates with the kernel to execute these commands.

Earlier, we discussed how the operating system helps humans and&#x20;

computers speak with each other.&#x20;

The shell is the part of the OS that allows you to do this.&#x20;

Think of this as a very helpful language interpreter between you and your system.&#x20;

Since you do not speak computer language or binary,&#x20;

you can't directly communicate with your system.&#x20;

This is where the shell comes in to help you.&#x20;

Your OS doesn't need the shell for most of its work, but&#x20;

it is an interface between you and what your system can offer.&#x20;

It allows you to perform math, run tests, and execute applications.&#x20;

More importantly, it allows you to combine these operations and&#x20;

connect applications to each other&#x20;

to perform complex and automated tasks.

Just as there are many Linux distributions,&#x20;

there are many different types of shells.&#x20;

We'll primarily focus on the Bash shell in this course.&#x20;

Let's continue to learn more about the shell.
