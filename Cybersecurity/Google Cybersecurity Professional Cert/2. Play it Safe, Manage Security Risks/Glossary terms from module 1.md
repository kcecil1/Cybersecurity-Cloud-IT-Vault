### Glossary Terms from Module 1: ADHD-Friendly Edition 🎉

Ready to tackle some key cybersecurity terms without the snooze fest? Think of this as a quick power-up session where you’ll collect knowledge, like coins in a video game! Let’s jump in, level up, and break these concepts down in a fun, easy-to-digest way.

---

### **Assess – The Security Checkpoint 🚦**

This is like going through airport security but for your cybersecurity defenses. In the fifth step of the **NIST RMF**, you’re checking if all the security controls (rules and measures) are working as they should. It’s like making sure your alarm system is really on before you leave the house.

---

### **Authorize – Owning the Risks 🎯**

Step six of the **NIST RMF** means taking responsibility for any risks. Imagine you’re the leader of the group, and you’re in charge of keeping everyone safe, even if things go wrong. It’s like being the captain of a ship, steering it through risky waters, and knowing you're responsible for any storm that hits.

---

### **Business Continuity – Keep the Party Going 🕺**

This is all about making sure the party never stops! Even if a disaster hits, the organization should have a plan in place to keep things running smoothly. Think of it like having backup generators at your concert—if the lights go out, you’ve got a plan to keep the music playing.

---

### **Categorize – Sorting the Threats Like a Pro 🗂️**

In the second step of **NIST RMF**, you’re organizing risks. It’s like sorting your sock drawer: some socks are no big deal, but others (like those fancy dress socks) need extra care. This step helps you figure out which risks need special attention.

---

### **External Threat – Danger from the Outside 👾**

This is any potential danger coming from outside your organization, like hackers or even natural disasters. Think of it as the wolves outside your village that are always looking for a way in.

---

### **Implement – Putting the Defense in Place 🛡️**

Step four of the **NIST RMF** is like building a wall around your digital kingdom. You’re actually putting up the defenses—the locks, the gates, the security guards—to keep your assets safe.

---

### **Internal Threat – The Sneaky Insider 🕵️‍♂️**

This threat comes from inside your organization, like a disgruntled employee or a vendor who betrays you. Think of it as someone who already has the key to your house but uses it for bad intentions. Yikes!

---

### **Monitor – Keeping an Eye on Things 👀**

This is the seventh step of the **NIST RMF**, where you’re making sure everything is running smoothly. It’s like checking the security cameras to see if anyone’s sneaking around when you’re not looking.

---

### **Prepare – Get Ready for the Worst ⚔️**

Step one of the **NIST RMF** is all about getting ready _before_ anything bad happens. You’re preparing your defenses like sharpening your sword before the battle starts.

---

### **Ransomware – The Data Kidnapper 💀💰**

Ransomware is like a digital thief who takes your data hostage and won’t give it back unless you pay them a ransom. It’s like someone stealing your favorite video game and making you pay to get it back—super annoying and super dangerous.

---

### **Risk – What Could Go Wrong? 😬**

Risk is like the chance of something bad happening. It’s like walking on a tightrope above a pool of sharks—there’s a _risk_ you could fall in, and you need to figure out how to avoid that!

---

### **Risk Mitigation – Dodging the Sharks 🦈**

This is how you plan to minimize the damage when something goes wrong. It's like having a safety net under that tightrope—if you fall, you don’t land in the shark pool.

---

### **Security Posture – The Kingdom’s Defense 🏰**

This is your kingdom’s overall strength in protecting itself. A strong **security posture** means you’re well-prepared, and your castle (organization) can defend itself and adapt to new threats, like constantly upgrading your fortress.

---

### **Select – Picking the Best Tools 🛠️**

In the third step of the **NIST RMF**, you’re choosing the best tools and defenses to protect your assets. It’s like picking the best shields and swords for your warriors.

---

### **Shared Responsibility – Teamwork Makes the Dream Work 👩‍💻👨‍💻**

Everyone plays a part in keeping the organization safe. It’s like a team sport—if one person isn’t pulling their weight, the whole defense could fall apart. So everyone needs to be on their A-game.

---

### **Social Engineering – The Manipulative Trickster 🎭**

This is when hackers use sneaky tactics to trick people into giving up private info. It’s like a con artist convincing someone to give them the keys to the kingdom by pretending to be someone they trust.

---

### **Vulnerability – The Weak Spot ⚡**

A vulnerability is like a crack in your castle wall. If you don’t patch it up, it’s a weak spot that enemies (threats) can exploit to get in and cause damage.

---
