### **Who Should Take the Practical Help Desk Course?**

This course is designed for students who are either looking to begin a career in IT or security or are early on in their career. It was designed to provide the core skills and knowledge required to start working at an entry level help desk job.

It also serves as a solid foundation of the requisite knowledge suggested for more advanced courses in the TCM Security Academy such as the [Practical Ethical Hacking](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-ethical-hacking-the-complete-course) course or [SOC 101](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/security-operations-soc-101).

**Student Testimonial**\


"I had an interview with a company today for a help desk position. They absolutely loved that I had a home lab built, and that I had some experience with a ticketing system like peppermint.

They asked me some of the exact questions you outlined in the ticket interrupts, and were impressed with my answers.

I just got off the phone a few minutes ago, and they have offered me the position!

So let me be the first of many (hopefully) that thank you personally for putting together the course and helping me get a job."\
