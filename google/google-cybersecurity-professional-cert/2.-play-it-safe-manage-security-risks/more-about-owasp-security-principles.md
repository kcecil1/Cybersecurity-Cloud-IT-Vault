#### OWASP Security Principles: The Fun, ADHD-Friendly Guide

Hey there, cybersecurity champion! 👋 Let’s talk about the **OWASP security principles** and how they help protect organizations from the bad guys out there. We’ll keep this light and fun, but by the end, you’ll have a great handle on how these principles fit into your everyday cybersecurity work.

***

#### A Quick Recap: What Are OWASP Security Principles?

OWASP stands for **Open Worldwide Application Security Project**, and it’s like the superhero organization of web security! These principles guide cybersecurity professionals in making sure systems stay safe. Whether you're checking logs, monitoring a SIEM dashboard (fancy talk for tracking security stuff), or using a vulnerability scanner (a tool that finds weak spots), you're applying these principles.

***

#### Let's Recap Some OWASP Principles You Already Know:

1. **Minimize Attack Surface Area**: Think of it like closing all doors and windows before leaving home—fewer entry points mean fewer vulnerabilities for attackers.
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only give people the keys they need to get into certain rooms, not every single door in the building!
3. **Defense in Depth**: Stack your defenses like layers of a cake. If one layer gets breached, others will still protect you.
4. **Separation of Duties**: Don’t let one person have too much control—just like in a heist movie, where each team member has a specific role.
5. **Keep Security Simple**: Over-complicating things is like adding too many toppings to a pizza—it just becomes a mess.
6. **Fix Security Issues Correctly**: If something goes wrong, fix it right the first time—like patching a hole in a boat before sailing.

#### Now, Let’s Add Some New OWASP Principles to Your Toolkit!

Here are **four more** principles to level up your security game:

***

**1. Establish Secure Defaults – Let’s Start Safe!**

Imagine your favorite app starts up and everything is set to its most secure setting by default—no extra work needed. This principle is all about making sure that the **safest settings** are already in place. If you want to make something less secure (which you _shouldn’t_ do), it should take **extra effort**.

**Example:** Think of it like locking your front door. It should already be locked when you close it. You shouldn’t have to remind yourself to lock it every single time you leave!

***

**2. Fail Securely – If It Breaks, Stay Safe**

What happens if a security control breaks down or crashes? This principle says that even when things go wrong, the system should **default to its most secure state**.

**Example:** If a firewall (which blocks unwanted traffic) fails, it should block **everything** by default. It’s like your phone locking itself after too many failed password attempts—better safe than sorry!

***

**3. Don’t Trust Services – Be a Little Suspicious**

You wouldn’t hand over your wallet to just anyone, right? The same goes for third-party services. Just because a vendor or partner works with you doesn’t mean you should **automatically trust their security**.

**Example:** Say an airline works with a third-party company to track reward points for customers. The airline should double-check that everything's accurate before sending out those points to customers—don’t assume the vendor’s system is flawless!

***

**4. Avoid Security by Obscurity – Hiding Isn’t Security**

Security shouldn’t rely on hiding things like **source code** or system details. Even if attackers know what your defenses look like, you should still be safe because your defenses are **strong** enough to stand on their own.

**Example:** It’s like having a sturdy lock on your door. Even if someone knows what kind of lock you have, they shouldn’t be able to break it without the key.

#### Key Takeaways 📝

* **OWASP security principles** are your guide to keeping systems safe in the workplace.
* As a **cybersecurity analyst**, you'll use these principles whether you’re digging through logs, monitoring dashboards, or testing for vulnerabilities.
* These principles aren’t just theoretical—they're part of your everyday tasks and help you protect your organization and its users.

#### Quick Quiz! 🎮

1. **What does it mean to "fail securely"?**
   * (Hint: Think about what happens when a firewall stops working!)
2. **Why shouldn’t we trust third-party services automatically?**
3. **Can you give an example of “establishing secure defaults” in something you use daily?**
   * (Hint: What settings should be enabled by default in your apps?)

Answer these, and you'll be well on your way to mastering the OWASP security principles! 🎉
