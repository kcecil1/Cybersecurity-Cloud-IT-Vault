# More about playbooks

#### **Playbook Overview: More Than Just Steps**

* **What it is**: A playbook isn't just a list of steps, it’s also tied to a bigger strategy.
* **Think of it like**: If the steps in the playbook are a recipe, then the strategy is the cooking plan. It not only tells you _what_ to do but also _why_ you’re doing it and _who_ should be doing it. So, in a security incident, it's like having a head chef (the strategy) assigning tasks to different chefs (team members), with each person responsible for a specific part of the recipe.

#### **Living Documents: Constant Updates**

* **What it is**: Playbooks are "living documents," which means they’re constantly evolving and being updated.
* **Think of it like**: Imagine your recipe book keeps getting new pages added as new cooking techniques or ingredients come out. Maybe there’s a new cooking tool that makes things easier, or a new regulation says you need to cook things at a specific temperature. Playbooks in cybersecurity work the same way—they get updated whenever there's a change in the industry, a new threat emerges, or someone spots a mistake in the old version.

**Reasons for updates**:

1. **Failure or oversight**: Something was missing or didn’t work as expected.
2. **Industry changes**: New laws or compliance standards pop up (like how food safety laws can change in the kitchen).
3. **Evolving threats**: Hackers keep inventing new tricks, so the playbook needs to adapt.

#### **Different Types of Playbooks**

* **What it is**: Different situations call for different playbooks, depending on the type of attack or vulnerability.
* **Think of it like**: Just like you wouldn’t use a cake recipe to make pasta, you don’t use the same playbook for every security threat. Each organization develops its own playbooks based on their unique needs, location, and the types of threats they face. For example, ransomware, phishing attacks, or business email compromise (BEC) might each have a different playbook.

#### **Incident and Vulnerability Response Playbooks**

* **What it is**: These are two of the most common types of playbooks, especially for entry-level professionals.
* **Think of it like**: These playbooks are like your go-to recipes when cooking something simple but critical, like a basic pasta dish or scrambled eggs. Every chef (or in this case, cybersecurity professional) starts with these core recipes before moving on to more complex dishes.

Both **incident** and **vulnerability response playbooks** have a list of predefined steps, like:

* **Preparation**: Getting your ingredients ready (gathering info and setting up tools).
* **Detection and Analysis**: Checking if your dish is on track (finding out if there’s a threat).
* **Containment and Eradication**: Fixing a mistake if you added too much salt (stopping and fixing the threat).
* **Recovery**: Making sure everything is clean and tidy after cooking (returning systems to normal after fixing the issue).

#### **Business Continuity Plan: The Bigger Picture**

* **What it is**: These playbooks often tie into an organization’s **business continuity plan**.
* **Think of it like**: If an organization is a restaurant, a business continuity plan is like having a backup plan for running the restaurant even if things go wrong, like a power outage or a kitchen fire. It’s a long-term plan to make sure the business keeps operating no matter what happens.

Incident and vulnerability response playbooks are tools within this bigger plan, designed to minimize damage and get things back on track quickly when an issue occurs.

***

#### **Risk and Urgency: It’s a Matter of Time**

* **What it is**: The risk level in an incident depends on how likely the threat is and how much damage it can cause.
* **Think of it like**: If you spill water in the kitchen, it's one thing. But if you spill oil near a hot stove, that’s way more dangerous. Security risks work the same way. The higher the threat, the faster you need to act. Playbooks help ensure you react with the right level of urgency to avoid making things worse.

***

#### **Why Steps Matter: Legal and Forensic Concerns**

* **What it is**: Following the steps in the playbook is crucial for legal and forensic reasons.
* **Think of it like**: Imagine you’re baking and competing in a cooking show. If you don’t follow the recipe exactly, you might get disqualified. In cybersecurity, if you don’t follow the steps, you risk breaking legal rules or ruining forensic evidence (which is like the digital fingerprints left behind during an attack). If the evidence is mishandled, it can’t be used to investigate or prosecute the attackers.

#### **Common Playbook Steps**:

These steps keep appearing in incident and vulnerability playbooks:

1. **Preparation**: Getting ready before something goes wrong.
2. **Detection**: Spotting the issue.
3. **Analysis**: Figuring out how bad the issue is.
4. **Containment**: Stopping the issue from getting worse.
5. **Eradication**: Removing the threat entirely.
6. **Recovery**: Restoring normal operations.

***

#### **Key Takeaways: Learning from Mistakes**

* **What it is**: Every incident teaches you something.
* **Think of it like**: After cooking a dish, you reflect on what went wrong (maybe you burned something or didn’t add enough seasoning) and you adjust the recipe for next time. Security teams do the same—they look back on every incident and update the playbook to make sure they're better prepared in the future.

#### **Resources for More Information**

If you plan to work in cybersecurity outside the U.S., there are specific guidelines from other countries you should check out, such as:

* **UK's National Cyber Security Center** (NCSC)
* **Australia's Cyber Incident Response Plan**
* **Japan's JPCERT/CC Guidelines**
* **Canada's Ransomware Playbook**
* **Scotland's Playbook Templates**

Each country has its own rules and standards for handling security incidents, and these playbooks adapt to fit those requirements.

**Quick Recap**:

* Playbooks are evolving manuals that provide clear steps and strategy for dealing with security incidents.
* They are updated regularly to keep up with new threats and changes in laws.
* Different playbooks exist for different situations, and they are part of a larger plan to keep a business running smoothly, even after an incident.
* Playbooks guide you through common steps like detection, containment, and recovery, helping avoid mistakes and legal issues.
* Learning from past incidents is key to improving future responses.
