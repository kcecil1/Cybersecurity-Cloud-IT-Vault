# Security starts with asset clarification

Here’s a fun, ADHD-friendly breakdown of the video transcript:

### 🔑 **The "Where Are My Keys?" Problem**

Ever lose your keys right before you have to go somewhere important? 😬

* **Stressful, right?** Now, imagine a business with TONS of important things (assets) they need to protect—it's like looking for your keys, but 10x harder! 🔍

***

### 🏢 **Your New Job: Security Team for a Small Online Retailer**

* The company is **growing**, and now they have **more customers** → more **assets to protect**!
* Let’s say each of you are responsible for **10 assets**. 📱💻📈
* That’s a LOT of things to keep track of! 😅

***

### 🛠 **What is Asset Management?**

* **Asset Management = Tracking the important stuff** (aka assets) + **identifying the risks** that could mess with them.
* **Assets** can be anything valuable to the company—like **equipment**, **data**, or **intellectual property**.
* All security plans revolve around **protecting assets**! 🔐

### 🐑 **The Sheep Analogy**: Why Asset Inventory Matters

* **Asset Inventory** = Your **list** of all the things that need to be protected. 📋
* Think of it like being a **shepherd** watching over your sheep. 🐑
  * You need to know **how many sheep** you have to **take care of them** properly.
  * If one sheep goes missing, you’ll get an **alert**! 🚨

### 🧮 **Asset Classification: Ranking Your Stuff**

* Just like you might rank your **wallet** more important than your **shoes**, businesses classify their assets based on **importance**. 👜 > 👟
* This is called **Asset Classification**, and here’s how it works:

#### Basic Classification Levels:

1. **Public**: Share with anyone. 🗣
2. **Internal-only**: Share only inside the company. 🏢
3. **Confidential**: Only for people working on specific projects. 🕵️‍♀️
4. **Restricted**: Super sensitive stuff. Only a select few should know! 🛑

***

### 🏷️ **Examples of Asset Classification in Action:**

* **Confidential**: Internal emails about a new product should only be seen by the team working on it. 📧
* **Restricted**: Only certain people should have access to specific rooms in the office. 🚪👀

***

### ⚙️ **Why Asset Management is a Big Deal**

* **Classification** helps determine whether an asset can be **shared**, **altered**, or **destroyed**. 🔄
* **Asset management** is a **continuous process** that helps you find **gaps** in security (like holes in your fence where sheep could escape). 🐑🕳
* **Keeping track** of everything valuable to the organization is **essential** for a strong security plan! 🏛

Now you’ve got the keys to understanding asset management—time to put them to use! 🔑
