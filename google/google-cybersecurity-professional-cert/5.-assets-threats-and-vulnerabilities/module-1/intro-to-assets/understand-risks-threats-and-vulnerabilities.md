# Understand risks, threats, and vulnerabilities

Let’s dive into this security lesson with a fun, ADHD-friendly twist! 🚀

### 🎯 **The Security Trio: Risk, Threats, and Vulnerabilities**

Imagine security like a **video game**. You’ve got 3 enemies to defeat:

1. **Risk** 🛑: The _big boss_ that could mess up your day!
   * **Risk** = Anything that can hurt your precious assets (confidentiality, integrity, or availability). Think of it like a final boss waiting for the right opportunity to strike!
2. **Threats** ⚔️: These are the _minions_ trying to mess with you.
   * **Threats** = Circumstances or events that could attack you. Like a random monster popping up in your game, whether it’s a malicious hacker or a well-meaning but clumsy employee.
3. **Vulnerabilities** 🕳: The _holes_ in your defenses that threats can exploit.
   * **Vulnerabilities** = Weaknesses in your armor, like a cracked shield. These are the areas you need to watch closely before something sneaks in and causes problems.

### 🔥 **How These Three Work Together**

To make this clearer, think of your commute to work as a challenge in your game of life:

* **Risk**: Being late to work and getting in trouble. 🕒
* **Threat**: A flat tire caused by a sharp nail on the road. 🔩
* **Vulnerability**: Your tires being vulnerable to punctures. 🛞

You can’t fully prevent every risk, but you can **manage** it by lowering the chance of the threat happening. For example, driving on clean roads reduces the **likelihood** of your tires getting damaged.

**In Security:**

* Reduce **vulnerabilities** (patch those cracks!).
* Stay alert to **threats** (watch out for those minions!).
* Always aim to reduce **risk** (beat that final boss!).

### 🧠 **Calculating Risk: The Boss Battle Formula**

There’s a simple formula to calculate risk:\
**Likelihood x Impact = Risk**

Let’s say you have a high **likelihood** of a flat tire (lots of nails on the road), and the **impact** could be huge (you might lose your job). That’s a BIG risk! So, what do you do? **Reduce the likelihood**—drive on cleaner roads to lower that chance.

In business, security teams calculate risks to:

1. **Prevent costly events** 💰
2. **Identify system improvements** 🛠️
3. **Determine which risks are acceptable** ✅
4. **Prioritize critical assets** 📊

### 🛡️ **Types of Threats**: Who’s Attacking You?

Threats come in two main flavors:

1. **Intentional**: Malicious hackers trying to steal your treasure 💻
   * Example: A hacker targets a weak point (misconfigured app) to get sensitive info.
2. **Unintentional**: Accidental slip-ups like an employee holding the door open 🚪
   * Example: An employee unknowingly lets in someone dangerous by being too polite!

### 🔓 **Types of Vulnerabilities**: Your Armor’s Weak Spots

Vulnerabilities come in two main categories:

1. **Technical**: Software or system weaknesses ⚙️
   * Example: A misconfigured app letting unauthorized users in.
2. **Human**: People making mistakes 🧍
   * Example: An employee losing their access card.

Both need to be protected because, just like in a game, one weak spot can let the enemies in!

### 🏆 **Key Takeaways**: Level Up Your Security Knowledge!

* **Risks, threats, and vulnerabilities** are like your game’s enemies—know them well, and you’ll win the security game!
* By mastering this trio, you can **build strong skills** that will make you a hero (aka, a trusted security analyst).
* Show your knowledge, and your future teammates will know you're a part of the **global security community**! 🌍🛡️

Now you’re ready to face those security challenges like a pro! 👾
