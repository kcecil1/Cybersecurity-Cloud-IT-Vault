# Common classification requirements

Let’s break down asset classification in a fun, ADHD-friendly way! 🎉

***

### 🛡️ **What’s Asset Management All About?**

* **Asset Management** = Tracking all the important stuff you need to protect.
* **Why?** Because you can’t protect what you don’t know exists! 🕵️‍♂️

Think of it like a big game of **Capture the Flag**—you need to know where all your flags are before you can guard them properly! 🚩

### 🏦 **Why Asset Management Matters:**

Imagine you're working at a **bank**. What do you need to protect? 💵

* **Money** (obviously), but also:
  * **Customer data** 🧑‍💻
  * **The building itself** 🏢
  * **Processes to keep things running smoothly** ⚙️
* Everything that’s valuable—digital or physical—needs to be tracked and protected!

Every asset has to be **classified** based on how important it is to the organization.

### 🎯 **How Do We Classify Assets?**

When organizations **classify** their assets, they ask four main questions:

1. **What do we have?** 📦
2. **Where is it?** 📍
3. **Who owns it?** 🤔
4. **How important is it?** 💰

Answering these helps businesses **label** assets and decide how sensitive they are. This makes it easier to figure out how much protection is needed! 🔐

### 📋 **Common Asset Classifications:**

Here’s the typical **classification levels** used by organizations:

1. **Restricted** 🔐: Top secret! Super sensitive, _need-to-know only_ (like secret mission details).
2. **Confidential** 🤫: Could cause **serious damage** if leaked (like customer data or financial records).
3. **Internal-only** 🏢: Safe within the company, but _don’t share outside_!
4. **Public** 🌐: No big deal if everyone sees it—totally cool to share with the world.

### 🤯 **The Tricky Parts of Classifying Assets:**

* Sometimes, it’s **hard to figure out who owns an asset**!
  * Example: If a company gives an employee a laptop, is it **company property** or does the **employee own it** if they store personal photos on it? 🖥️📸
* **Some info has multiple classifications** at the same time:
  * Example: A **letter** in the mail has **public info** (your name) and **confidential info** (your address). 📬
  * **Different parts** of the same thing might need **different levels of protection**!

***

### 🧠 **Key Takeaways:**

* **Every business is different**, so they’ll have their own unique classification needs.
* **Classifying assets** helps businesses protect their most valuable information and resources.
* **Information** is one of the **most important assets**—as a cybersecurity pro, you’ll be in charge of keeping it safe! 🧑‍💻🔐
* Understanding the **challenges** of classifying assets is key to helping businesses solve their security puzzles! 🧩

Now you’re ready to level up in asset management! Time to keep those important assets safe! 🛡️🚀
