# Threat modeling

Imagine you’re part of a security team at a mid-sized tech company that’s about to launch a new web-based service. The company wants to ensure that the service is secure before customers start using it, so your manager assigns you to participate in a threat modeling exercise. This isn’t just a theoretical activity—in the world of cybersecurity, threat modeling is a proactive approach that directly influences the defenses and strategies your organization puts in place.

**On-the-Job Application of Threat Modeling:**

1.  **Defining the Scope and Assets:**\
    The first step is sitting down with your team and the application developers. Together, you map out exactly what you’re trying to protect. For instance, you confirm the new service stores customer data, including email addresses and order histories. These are your key assets. On the job, you might ask:

    * “What sensitive data do we handle?”
    * “Which servers and APIs are involved?”
    * “Do we integrate with third-party services that might introduce risk?”

    By clearly identifying assets and the environment, you’re laying the foundation for determining where security efforts should focus. You document these details so everyone on the team knows what matters most.
2.  **Identifying Threat Actors and Attack Vectors:**\
    With assets defined, the next step in threat modeling is thinking like an attacker. You consider who might want to harm your company or steal your data—this could be cybercriminals seeking to profit from stolen personal info, or disgruntled insiders looking to cause chaos. On the job, you’ll:

    * Brainstorm potential external attackers, like a hacking group known for targeting customer data.
    * Consider internal threats, maybe a recently departed employee with system knowledge.
    * Think about common web application threats: SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and ransomware attacks targeting your data storage.

    This attacker mindset helps you anticipate where criminals might strike and what vulnerabilities they might exploit.
3. **Visualizing the Attack Surface Through Diagrams:**\
   Your team creates data flow diagrams that show how user requests travel from the user’s browser to your servers, through authentication systems, and into the databases. This is where you uncover potential weak spots, such as an input form that could be vulnerable to SQL injection if not sanitized. On the job, you might:
   * Map out every component: front-end UI, load balancers, application servers, databases, and external integrations.
   * Highlight trust boundaries—where data moves from a trusted system to a potentially untrusted environment.
   * Identify points where attackers might inject malicious code or intercept data.
4. **Analyzing Threats and Ranking Risks:**\
   Once you know the assets, attackers, and system architecture, you analyze how likely and severe each threat scenario is. For example, a common scenario might be: **An attacker exploits a missing input validation check to run malicious queries on the database.** On the job, you:
   * Assign risk scores to each identified threat, considering both the likelihood of occurrence and the potential impact if it happens.
   * Focus first on high-impact, easily exploitable threats. For instance, a SQL injection vulnerability that could expose all customer records might rank as a critical risk.
5.  **Choosing Mitigation Strategies:**\
    After ranking the threats, you decide how to respond. As a security analyst, you’d collaborate with developers and systems engineers to apply controls that reduce risk. On the job, this may mean:

    * Implementing parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
    * Adding input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS attacks.
    * Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) and secure session handling to prevent unauthorized access.
    * Enforcing strict firewall rules and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to spot malicious traffic early.

    Each mitigation reduces the overall risk. You might also recommend backup and recovery solutions to handle ransomware threats, or network segmentation to limit the blast radius of an intrusion.
6. **Documenting and Learning from the Process:**\
   Finally, the team documents the entire threat modeling exercise: which threats were identified, how they were ranked, and how they were mitigated. This documentation helps everyone from management to front-line developers understand the security posture of the application. On the job, you will:
   * Create a final report with recommendations, steps taken, and lessons learned.
   * Present findings to stakeholders so they know why certain security features were prioritized.
   * Suggest adding periodic threat modeling sessions into the development lifecycle, so new features and changes are always assessed.
7. **Continuous Improvement:**\
   Threat modeling isn’t a one-and-done exercise. Over time, the application evolves, attackers get smarter, and new vulnerabilities surface. On the job, you’ll:
   * Schedule follow-up threat modeling sessions whenever major changes are made to the application.
   * Update threat intelligence feeds and keep track of evolving attack methods.
   * Ensure that security measures align with the latest industry standards and compliance requirements.

**Real Impact in the Workplace:**\
Threat modeling transforms abstract knowledge about vulnerabilities and attackers into a concrete action plan. By being proactive, you help your organization harden its defenses before attackers strike. Your work reduces the likelihood of a costly data breach, protects customer trust, and meets regulatory standards. The result? You become a crucial player in creating a safer digital environment for your company and its customers.

In essence, threat modeling is about thinking ahead, anticipating how attackers might strike, and making smart, informed decisions that strengthen the entire security posture of the organization. It’s a proactive approach that, when done right, consistently yields tangible security improvements on the job.
