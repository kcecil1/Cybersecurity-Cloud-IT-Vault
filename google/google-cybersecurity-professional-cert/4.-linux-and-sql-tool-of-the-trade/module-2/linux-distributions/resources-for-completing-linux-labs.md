# Resources for completing Linux Labs

Here’s a fun, ADHD-friendly breakdown of how to use **Qwiklabs** for your Linux labs! Think of it as a mission to complete, and you’ve got the tools and tips to succeed. 🚀

***

#### 🎮 **How to Start Your Mission (aka Launch Qwiklabs)**

1. **Launch Qwiklabs**:
   * Click **Launch App** from Coursera. A new tab opens with Qwiklabs’ instructions 🖱️.
   * Now, click the big green **Start Lab** button to get your lab going. Your lab will start in a terminal window—this is where the magic happens ✨.
2. **Start the Lab**:
   * When you click **Start Lab**, you’ll get a temporary terminal window. The timer starts ticking ⏳, but don’t worry—you’ll have plenty of time to finish!
3. **Open Linux Console**:
   * Want to see the terminal in full screen? Click **Open Linux Console**, and boom—you get a full view 🖥️. Close it anytime, and keep working in the original tab.

#### ⏱️ **Keeping an Eye on the Clock**

* The **timer** is your countdown buddy. Once the timer hits 00:00:00, your lab closes, so keep an eye on it, but stay cool—you’ve got this!
