# Phil, Learn and grow in the cybersecurity field

Here’s a fun, ADHD-friendly breakdown of Phil's video about getting into cybersecurity. Let's keep it light and engaging to make sure the key points stick!

**👋 Meet Phil: The CISO of Google Cloud**

* Phil’s a big deal in cybersecurity. He’s been around since the internet was basically a baby! 🍼💻
* Fun fact: He worked on one of the **first internet banking systems** in the mid-90s, back when encryption was still a “what’s that?” concept.
* Imagine building web browsers and servers when Google didn’t even exist! 🕰️ **Throwback** to when the internet was just figuring things out.

**🌍 Why You Should Keep Learning**

* **Cybersecurity never stops changing**—the internet from 12 months ago already feels like ancient history in tech terms 📅. (And don't even get us started on the '90s!).
* Phil reminds us that even **he doesn’t know everything** all the time—sometimes he has to look stuff up. So, if you feel overwhelmed, don’t worry—you’re in good company!

**🎯 Step-by-Step: How to Learn Cybersecurity**

* **Start small**. Everyone begins with the basics.
* Phil wasn’t born knowing Linux or how to code. He had to learn just like you will! Think of it as starting a new video game—everyone's a noob at first 🎮.
* The secret sauce? **Incremental learning**. Focus on mastering small pieces—write some simple code, play with it, and learn bit by bit.

**💡 The Growth Mindset**

* Phil gives the thumbs up to **learning as you go**. It’s okay not to know everything upfront. 🔍
* Start with what you can understand, then **build up your knowledge**—like adding new tools to your superhero utility belt 🦸.
* Don’t stress if you feel a bit anxious about learning something new. With practice, you’ll start trusting yourself to pick things up!

**🔑 Key Takeaways (In Case You Forget)**

* **You don't have to learn everything at once**. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither is your cybersecurity expertise 🏛️.
* **Start small, learn as you go**—tinker with code, explore Linux, and keep leveling up! 🚀
* It’s okay to **look things up**—even Phil does it. Just keep learning, and you’ll become a cyber pro in no time!

So, remember: Don’t get overwhelmed, take it step by step, and enjoy the process! Cybersecurity is a huge world, and you’ve got all the time in the (digital) world to explore it! 🌐🔐
