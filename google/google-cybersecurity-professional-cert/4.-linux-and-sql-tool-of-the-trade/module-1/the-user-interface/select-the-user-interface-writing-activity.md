# Select the User Interface Writing Activity

In this exercise, you will review multiple scenarios and decide if a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI) would be more effective. You will also need to explain your reasoning. After you submit your reflection, you can compare your answers to the feedback provided.

**Note**: Coursera will mark each item that you submit as correct, but to improve your understanding, you should carefully consider how your response aligns with the feedback.

#### 1.

Question 1

You are a security professional training all employees at your company on creating a strong password. You explain different strategies that they can use for making passwords secure. You also demonstrate how to change passwords. Your teammates have a wide range of technical expertise.

In this scenario, should you use a GUI or CLI to demonstrate how to change passwords? Explain your reasoning in 2-3 sentences.

I would demonstrate changing passwords using the GUI for less technically savvy teammates, as it's more intuitive and user-friendly. For more technically proficient teammates, I would use the CLI, which allows for faster and more flexible password management, catering to their advanced skill level and familiarity. This approach tailors the demonstration to the teamâ€™s varying expertise.

Correct

Thank you for your response. A GUI would be more effective in this scenario. This is because GUIs are easier for beginners to navigate. These individuals will likely already have experience using GUIs on their phones and computers but may not be familiar with CLIs.

Question 2

You are reviewing log files for a department at your company. Log file names are supposed to include the name of the department. After reviewing multiple log files, you realize that the file names do not include the name of the department. You decide to rename all the log files for this department. There are hundreds of log files.

In this scenario, should you use a GUI or CLI to rename the log files? Explain your reasoning in 2-3 sentences.

I would use the CLI to rename the log files, as it allows for efficient automation with a quick script, saving time and effort. Renaming each file manually through a GUI would be impractical given the large number of log files.

Correct

Thank you for your response. A CLI would generally be more effective in this scenario. This is because CLIs allow you to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. In this case, you could rename all the files at once. If you used a GUI for this task, you would need to rename the files individually unless you had access to a special program for batch file renaming.

Question 3

You are installing multiple applications. You want to keep a history of commands while you install the applications. This will allow you to check later to ensure that you installed all of the necessary applications and that you installed them correctly.

In this scenario, should you use a GUI or CLI to install the applications? Explain your reasoning in 2-3 sentences.

Status: \[object Object]

1 / 1 point

I would use the CLI to install the applications, as it automatically logs all commands in a history file, which allows for easy review of the installation process. This ensures that I can verify if all necessary applications were installed correctly and troubleshoot any issues by referring back to the command history. Additionally, the CLI is often more efficient for bulk installations compared to using a GUI.

Correct

Thank you for your response. A CLI would be more effective in this scenario. This is because a CLI records a history of all commands used in the CLI. GUIs do not necessarily include a history file of all actions performed in the GUI.
