# Module 3 Glossary

Here's a fun, ADHD-friendly guide to the glossary terms from Course 4, Module 3!

***

#### **🗺️ Absolute File Path:**

Think of it like a treasure map 🏴‍☠️ starting from the very beginning (the **root**) and leading you directly to the treasure (file or directory)!

***

#### **🧳 Argument (Linux):**

This is like giving extra instructions when you tell someone to grab **your red jacket**—the **red jacket** is the extra detail (the argument) that the person needs to do the job.

***

#### **🔐 Authentication:**

It’s like showing your ID to a security guard—proving **who** you are. You’re the real deal! No fake identities allowed!

***

#### **🔑 Authorization:**

Now that the guard knows who you are, they decide which doors 🚪 you can open. It's about **what** you’re allowed to access!

***

#### **🐚 Bash:**

Meet **Bash**, the trusty tour guide 🧭 of most Linux systems! It’s the shell that tells your computer where to go and what to do.

***

#### **📢 Command:**

A **command** is like shouting an order, “Do the dishes!” 🧼 and the computer (or your sibling) follows that command... hopefully.

***

#### **🗺️ File Path:**

This is the **address** of a file on your computer. Like finding your friend’s house, but instead, it’s a file’s home.

***

#### **🏛️ Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):**

This is like a **city map** for your Linux OS 🏙️. It organizes everything into neat districts so you don’t get lost!

***

#### **🕵️‍♂️ Filtering:**

Filtering is like putting on special glasses 🕶️ that only let you see the things you’re looking for (data matching certain conditions).

***

#### **✏️ nano:**

Need to quickly scribble a note? **nano** is your handy, built-in, command-line **notebook**!

***

#### **🔧 Options:**

Options are like giving your friend extra tips on how to do something: "Make my coffee, but make it iced! 🧊" That **iced** detail is the option.

***

#### **🔓 Permissions:**

These are like keys 🔑 to your files. They control who can read, write, or use a file.

***

#### **🛡️ Principle of Least Privilege:**

Imagine only giving your pet **just enough treats** to stay happy without spoiling them. It’s the idea of granting the **minimum access** someone needs to do their job.

***

#### **🗺️ Relative File Path:**

This is like starting from **where you are right now** (your current location) instead of starting from the root of the city map.

***

#### **🏠 Root Directory:**

The **root directory** is like the **top of the tree** 🌳. Everything starts here and branches out into the rest of the system.

***

#### **🦸 Root User (Superuser):**

This person has **ALL the powers** 🦸, like a superhero who can change anything in the system.

***

#### **📥 Standard Input:**

This is like the **instructions** you give your computer through the command line. You’re telling it what to do!

***

#### **📤 Standard Output:**

After the computer listens to your instructions, **standard output** is its **response** through the shell—like hearing, “Got it!”

Now you're ready to command Linux like a pro, with your super fun and ADHD-friendly glossary at hand! 🌟
