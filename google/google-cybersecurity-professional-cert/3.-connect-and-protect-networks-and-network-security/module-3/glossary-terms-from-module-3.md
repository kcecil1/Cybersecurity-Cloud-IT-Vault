# Glossary terms from module 3

Let’s turn these terms into a **spy mission** to make it fun and ADHD-friendly! Imagine you’re part of a team of **cyber agents**, and these terms represent different **attacks** or **defenses** in your cyber mission.

***

#### **Active Packet Sniffing: The Hacker Sabotage**

* **Mission Brief**: In **active packet sniffing**, the enemy doesn’t just **listen**; they actually **mess with your data** while it’s traveling through the network. Think of it like the hacker **rerouting a message** or **planting false information** while you're trying to send a secret transmission.

***

#### **Botnet: The Zombie Army**

* **Mission Brief**: A **botnet** is like a **zombie army** of infected computers, all controlled by one **evil mastermind** called the **bot-herder**. They can make this army do things like launch **attacks** or spread malware, all without the zombies (computers) knowing they’re part of the attack!

***

#### **Denial of Service (DoS) Attack: The Jammed Signal**

* **Mission Brief**: A **DoS attack** is like a hacker jamming your **radio signal**. They send so much **junk traffic** to your network that it gets overwhelmed, causing legitimate users to be **cut off** and unable to connect.

***

#### **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack: The Global Jam**

* **Mission Brief**: A **DDoS attack** is the same **jammed signal** scenario, but it’s like the enemy has **agents all around the world** sending **junk traffic** from **multiple locations** at once. This makes the attack even **harder to stop**.

***

#### **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): The Error Reporter**

* **Mission Brief**: ICMP is like the **messenger** that tells devices when something goes wrong. For example, when a data packet gets lost or hits a dead end, ICMP is the protocol that says, "**Hey, this didn't go through!**"

***

#### **ICMP Flood: The Flood of Messages**

* **Mission Brief**: An **ICMP flood** is when the hacker abuses the **messenger** (ICMP) by sending a flood of ICMP packets to a network, overloading it with messages until it **crashes**.

***

#### **IP Spoofing: The Fake Identity**

* **Mission Brief**: In **IP spoofing**, the hacker **pretends** to be someone else, by changing their **IP address** to look like it’s coming from a **trusted source**. It’s like forging an ID card to sneak into a restricted area.

***

#### **On-Path Attack: The Spy in the Middle**

* **Mission Brief**: In an **on-path attack**, the hacker sneaks in between two trusted devices, like a spy hiding in the **middle of a conversation**, listening in or even **altering** the messages before they reach their destination.

***

#### **Packet Sniffing: The Spy Eavesdropping**

* **Mission Brief**: **Packet sniffing** is when a hacker acts like a **spy** who taps into the network to **listen in** on data packets, hoping to capture valuable information like **passwords** or **confidential messages**.

***

#### **Passive Packet Sniffing: The Silent Spy**

* **Mission Brief**: In **passive packet sniffing**, the hacker is like a **silent spy**—they just listen without changing anything, trying to gather intel on what’s happening on the network without being noticed.

***

#### **Ping of Death: The Overload Attack**

* **Mission Brief**: The **Ping of Death** is when the hacker sends a **massive ping packet** (much larger than normal) to a target, causing it to **crash** because it can’t handle such a large packet. It’s like giving someone a **firehose** when they asked for a glass of water!

***

#### **Replay Attack: The Hacker’s Echo**

* **Mission Brief**: In a **replay attack**, the hacker captures a legitimate data packet and then **replays** it later to trick the system. It’s like recording a **door access code** and using it again later to sneak in.

***

#### **Smurf Attack: The Echo Chamber of Doom**

* **Mission Brief**: In a **smurf attack**, the hacker uses a **stolen IP address** to send a flood of **ICMP echo requests** (pings) to a network, causing every device to respond at once, creating a **massive flood of traffic** that brings the network to a halt.

***

#### **SYN Flood Attack: The Incomplete Handshake**

* **Mission Brief**: In a **SYN flood attack**, the hacker sends a flood of **SYN packets** to initiate a connection, but never completes the **three-way handshake**. This leaves the server hanging, waiting for the connection, and eventually **overloads** it.

***

#### **Mission Complete!**

Now you’re armed with the knowledge of these **cyber tactics** and how they operate in the field. Whether it's **eavesdropping spies**, **forged identities**, or **global signal jamming**, you’re ready to face these challenges head-on!
