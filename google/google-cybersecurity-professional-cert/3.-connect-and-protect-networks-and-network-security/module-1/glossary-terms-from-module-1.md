# Glossary terms from module 1

Let’s turn this glossary into a fun, ADHD-friendly adventure! Imagine you're setting up an island and building your own data communication network. Each term in this glossary is like a tool or character that helps your island stay connected with the rest of the world. Let's meet these fun, techy helpers!

***

#### 🌊 **Bandwidth (The River Flow)**:

* **What it does**: Think of bandwidth as the river on your island. The **wider** the river, the **more** boats (data) can travel at the same time.
* **How fast**: It’s measured in **bits per second**—like how many tiny boats can cross the river every second!

***

#### ☁️ **Cloud Computing (Your Floating Warehouse)**:

* **What it does**: You don’t want all your stuff stored on the island, right? So, you have floating **cloud warehouses** in the sky. All your apps, photos, and games live there.
* **Access**: You can grab them anytime over the internet!

***

#### 🌐 **Cloud Network (The Giant Library in the Sky)**:

* **What it does**: A **cloud network** is like a giant library floating in space. All the data and resources live there, and you access it via the internet—like sending a drone to fetch a book!

***

#### 📦 **Data Packet (The Messenger Bird)**:

* **What it does**: When you send a message or email, it gets broken into tiny **data packets** (like little messenger birds) that fly from your device to another.

***

#### 📢 **Hub (The Loud Town Crier)**:

* **What it does**: A **hub** is like a town crier standing in the middle of the village, shouting every message to **everyone** on the island. Not the best for secrets!

***

#### 📫 **Internet Protocol (IP) (The Postal System)**:

* **What it does**: IP is like the **postal system**. It sets the rules for how your messenger birds (data packets) know where to go and how to get there.

***

#### 🏡 **IP Address (Your House Address)**:

* **What it does**: An **IP address** is like your island’s house number. It’s a unique string of characters that identifies where your home (device) is located on the internet.

***

#### 🏠 **Local Area Network (LAN) (The Island Village)**:

* **What it does**: Your **LAN** is your little village on the island. All your homes, schools, and shops are connected—like a local chat network!

***

#### 🏷️ **MAC Address (Your ID Badge)**:

* **What it does**: A **MAC address** is like your **ID badge**. It’s unique to each physical device, so no two devices on the island have the same one!

***

#### 🌐 **Modem (The Bridge to the Mainland)**:

* **What it does**: The **modem** is your bridge from the island to the mainland (internet). It lets your data packets get to the big internet city!

***

#### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Network (Your Island Neighbors)**:

* **What it does**: A **network** is your group of friends and neighbors on the island, all chatting and sharing resources.

***

#### 🏛️ **OSI Model (The Communication Blueprint)**:

* **What it does**: The **OSI model** is like a step-by-step blueprint for how the devices on the island communicate. It breaks everything down into **7 layers** to make sure the messages get through correctly.

***

#### 🕵️‍♀️ **Packet Sniffing (The Spyglass)**:

* **What it does**: **Packet sniffing** is like using a spyglass to watch the messenger birds (data packets) flying across the sky. It’s a way to capture and inspect them—very useful for security checks!

***

#### 🚪 **Port (Your Message Sorting Door)**:

* **What it does**: A **port** is like a magic door that sorts all the messages coming to your house. Each door (port) handles different kinds of data.

***

#### 🚤 **Router (The Island Ferry)**:

* **What it does**: The **router** is the ferry that takes data packets between different islands (networks). It helps connect your island with others!

***

#### ⚡ **Speed (The Fast Boats)**:

* **What it does**: **Speed** is all about how fast the boats (data) can travel between islands. The faster the boats, the quicker your message arrives!

***

#### 📬 **Switch (The Smart Messenger)**:

* **What it does**: A **switch** is like a super-smart messenger. Instead of telling everyone in the village the same message, it only delivers it to the specific house that needs it!

***

#### 📦💡 **TCP/IP Model (Your Parcel Delivery Plan)**:

* **What it does**: The **TCP/IP model** is like a shipping plan for delivering packages (data). It’s a framework that shows how packages are sent and received, so nothing gets lost.

***

#### 🛠️ **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) (The Careful Builder)**:

* **What it does**: **TCP** is like a builder who makes sure every piece of the house (data) is delivered in the right order. It double-checks everything so nothing’s missing.

***

#### 📦⚡ **User Datagram Protocol (UDP) (The Speedy Messenger)**:

* **What it does**: **UDP** is the island’s **speedy messenger**. It doesn’t wait for confirmations and just throws the package (data) as fast as possible. It’s faster but a little risky!

***

#### 🌍 **Wide Area Network (WAN) (The Island Federation)**:

* **What it does**: A **WAN** is like connecting a bunch of islands into one huge federation! It covers a massive area, like a whole country.

***

That’s your fun guide to network terms! Now your island is equipped with all the right tools to stay connected with the outside world, one data packet at a time!
