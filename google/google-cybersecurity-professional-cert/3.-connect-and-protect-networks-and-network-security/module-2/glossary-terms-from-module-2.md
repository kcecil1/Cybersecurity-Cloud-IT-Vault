# Glossary terms from module 2

Let's imagine all of these network terms are **characters** in a **spy universe**—each one with their unique skills and abilities! This will make the glossary not only fun but also **memorable**.

#### **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**:

Meet **Agent ARP**, the **navigator** of the team! When you're sending a message and don’t know how to reach the next person, ARP looks up the **MAC address** (the secret code) of the next router or device to help get your message through.

#### **Cloud-Based Firewalls**:

These are the **sky guardians**—firewalls hosted by the cloud service provider. They act as the **floating force fields** that monitor and block suspicious traffic from reaching your cloud data.

#### **Controlled Zone**:

Imagine the **VIP section** of a club. Only **authorized** people are allowed in here, protecting your internal network from the chaotic “uncontrolled zone” (the general public).

#### **Domain Name System (DNS)**:

**Agent DNS** is the **translator** in the spy universe. When you ask for a website like “spyhacks.com,” DNS translates that into an **IP address** (like the street address) so you can find it.

#### **Encapsulation**:

Encapsulation is like giving your **secret message** to a trusted courier, who wraps it in a safe **packet** before sending it off through dangerous territory, ensuring it stays secure.

#### **Firewall**:

The **bouncer** at the door of your network party! The firewall checks every guest (data packet) trying to enter and decides whether they’re on the **guest list** (allowed in) or need to be blocked.

#### **Forward Proxy Server**:

This is like the **spy handler** who controls what their agents (users) can do on the internet. They monitor and restrict your access to certain online destinations.

#### **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**:

**Agent HTTP** is the **postman** delivering letters between your computer and website servers. It’s not super secure, so people can snoop on the messages if they really want to.

#### **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**:

This is **Agent HTTP’s** cooler, secretive sibling—wearing a **lock** around its messages! HTTPS ensures your communication between clients and servers is **encrypted** and safe from snoopers.

#### **IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi)**:

The **Wi-Fi squad** is like a group of **spies** communicating via secret wireless signals. They follow the rules set by the **IEEE 802.11** to make sure their communications are secure and fast.

#### **Network Protocols**:

These are the **rules of engagement** in the spy world. They tell the devices **how to communicate**, what to say first, and when to say it, so everyone’s on the same page.

#### **Network Segmentation**:

This is like putting **laser walls** in different parts of your spy headquarters, isolating different sections so intruders can’t sneak from one part to another.

#### **Port Filtering**:

Imagine a **club with many doors** (ports), each leading to a different part of the building. **Port filtering** is the security guard who decides which doors can stay open and which ones should be locked.

#### **Proxy Server**:

This is your **middleman agent**—the proxy takes requests from users and forwards them to the destination server. It’s like sending messages through a secret courier.

#### **Reverse Proxy Server**:

This is the **doorman** for your internal servers. It controls who can access the **hidden treasures** of your network, making sure only authorized people get through.

#### **Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)**:

SFTP is the **courier** who only delivers files in a **secure briefcase**—encrypted and safe from prying eyes as they travel across the network.

#### **Secure Shell (SSH)**:

**SSH** is like the **secret tunnel** that lets you communicate with a remote system safely. You get a secure “shell” where no one can listen in on your conversation.

#### **Security Zone**:

This is the **safe room** within the network. It’s highly guarded and keeps everything safe from the dangerous world outside.

#### **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)**:

**SNMP** is the **spy director**, monitoring and managing all the devices on the network. It gathers intel on how everything’s working and reports back to HQ.

#### **Stateful Firewall**:

The **stateful firewall** is the **smart bouncer** who keeps track of who’s inside the party and checks to see if return visitors are who they say they are.

#### **Stateless Firewall**:

The **stateless firewall** is the **basic bouncer**—following a simple checklist. It doesn’t remember anything about past visitors and makes decisions based on predefined rules.

#### **Subnetting**:

**Subnetting** is like dividing your spy base into **different rooms**, each with its own secret missions. It keeps things organized and secure by isolating each group.

#### **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**:

TCP is the **choreographer**, making sure two devices are perfectly in sync and know exactly when to **send and receive data**.

#### **Uncontrolled Zone**:

This is the **wild** area outside your HQ. It’s where danger lurks because anyone can access it without permission—kind of like the public internet.

#### **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**:

A VPN is your **cloak of invisibility**! It hides your real location and encrypts your data as you move through unsafe places like public Wi-Fi or the internet.

#### **Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)**:

WPA is the **password lock** that protects your Wi-Fi network. It keeps **unauthorized spies** from intercepting your wireless communications.

Now you’ve got your entire **spy squad glossary** ready for action! Each term plays a unique role in defending (or attacking) the network. Time to suit up, agent!
