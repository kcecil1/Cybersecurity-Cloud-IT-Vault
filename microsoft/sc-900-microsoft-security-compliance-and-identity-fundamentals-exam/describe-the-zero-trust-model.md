# Describe the Zero Trust model

Let’s make this ADHD-friendly with bite-sized explanations, vivid analogies, and actionable steps.

***

#### **Big Idea: What is the Zero Trust Model?**

* **Trust No One, Verify Everything**: Assume every network is untrusted, even your own.
* **Why It Matters**: Attackers can bypass old defenses, so Zero Trust strengthens security.

***

#### **How It Works: 3 Guiding Principles**

1. **Verify Explicitly**: Always check—who are you, where are you, what are you doing?
   * Example: Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) and track behavior for anomalies.
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Only give people access to what they _absolutely_ need.
   * Example: A cashier doesn’t get access to the store’s payroll system.
3. **Assume Breach**: Plan as if attackers are already inside.
   * Example: Divide your network into zones (segmentation) and encrypt sensitive data.

#### **Six Foundational Pillars of Zero Trust**

1. **Identities**: Verify users, services, or devices trying to access resources.
   * **Tool**: Strong authentication + least privilege rules.
   * **Analogy**: Only verified people with the right ID can get into specific rooms.
2. **Devices**: Watch for risky devices connecting to the network.
   * **Tool**: Monitor compliance and health.
   * **Analogy**: Inspect every suitcase at an airport.
3. **Applications**: Manage permissions and discover unapproved apps ("Shadow IT").
   * **Tool**: Control access and usage.
   * **Analogy**: Locking doors to rooms you don’t want anyone entering.
4. **Data**: Protect and label sensitive data.
   * **Tool**: Encrypt and classify based on sensitivity.
   * **Analogy**: Keeping your diary safe with locks and "TOP SECRET" labels.
5. **Infrastructure**: Monitor servers, configurations, and unusual behavior.
   * **Tool**: Use telemetry (data tracking) to spot threats.
   * **Analogy**: A security guard patrolling for suspicious activity.
6. **Networks**: Divide and protect networks deeply (micro-segmentation).
   * **Tool**: Use end-to-end encryption and real-time monitoring.
   * **Analogy**: Building walls within your castle to protect the treasure room.

#### **Why It’s Cool**

* Zero Trust stops attackers who think getting past the “front gate” is enough.
* It keeps sensitive data secure, even if something gets hacked.

***

#### **How to Remember This**

1. **Picture It**: Imagine a super-secure building where:
   * Everyone shows ID (verify explicitly).
   * Each person gets access to just one room (least privilege).
   * Security assumes intruders might already be inside (assume breach).
2. **Chunk It**: Learn the principles today, then tackle 1-2 pillars tomorrow.
3. **Use Mnemonics**:
   * **VLA = Verify, Least Access, Assume Breach.**
   * **Six Pillars = I (Identities), D (Devices), A (Applications), D (Data), I (Infrastructure), N (Networks) = “I DAD IN.”**

#### **Key Takeaway**

The **Zero Trust Model** is like running a high-security operation: no assumptions, strict checks, and robust defenses. Always verify, limit access, and act like someone’s already inside to keep your data safe.
