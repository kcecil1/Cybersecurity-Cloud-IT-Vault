# Introduction

#### **Big Idea**

Your mission is to learn how organizations protect data _everywhere_ (on their network or in the cloud) and follow the rules (compliance). This involves **key concepts** that are like puzzle pieces for security.

***

#### **What You’ll Learn**

1. **Shared Responsibility Model**: Think of this as teamwork—who handles what when it comes to security.
2. **Defense in Depth**: A layer cake of security—multiple defenses stacked together.
3. **Zero Trust Model**: Trust no one, verify everything.
4. **Encryption and Hashing**: Locking up data and giving it a unique fingerprint.
5. **Compliance**: Following the rules to protect data and keep it private.

#### **Why It Matters**

* Data is everywhere (home, work, cloud).
* Bad guys want it.
* Laws require organizations to protect it.

***

#### **Action Plan to Learn It**

1. **Visualize Concepts**: Picture the shared responsibility model as dividing chores, defense in depth as wearing armor, and Zero Trust as a security guard checking IDs at every door.
2. **Use Mnemonics**:
   * **S for Shared Responsibility** = **Split the chores.**
   * **D for Defense in Depth** = **Don’t stop at one lock.**
   * **Z for Zero Trust** = **Zero assumptions.**
3. **Chunk the Info**: Focus on just _one concept_ at a time (e.g., learn encryption today, Zero Trust tomorrow).
4. **Set Timers**: Study each piece for 5–10 minutes, take a 2-minute break, then move on.
5. **Teach Someone Else**: Pretend to explain these to a friend or even a stuffed animal.
