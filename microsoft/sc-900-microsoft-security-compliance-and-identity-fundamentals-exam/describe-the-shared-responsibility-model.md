# Describe the shared responsibility model

Let’s make this ADHD-friendly with a simplified breakdown and focus hacks.

***

#### **Big Idea: What is the Shared Responsibility Model?**

* **Old Way** (On-premises): You handle **everything**—hardware, software, physical security, data.
* **New Way** (Cloud): You **share the load** with the cloud provider.

#### **Responsibility Breakdown by Service Type**

1. **On-Premises**: You’re the boss of everything—like owning a house.
2. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**:
   * **Provider**: Physical stuff (datacenter, servers).
   * **You**: Software, data, apps, and security.
   * **Analogy**: Renting a server rack—your apps, your responsibility.
3. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**:
   * **Provider**: Infrastructure and operating systems.
   * **You**: Apps and data.
   * **Analogy**: Renting a kitchen—provider supplies appliances, you cook the food.
4. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**:
   * **Provider**: Almost everything.
   * **You**: Data, accounts, and device security.
   * **Analogy**: Subscribing to a meal delivery service—you just eat, but keep your fridge safe.

#### **Always Your Responsibility**

* **Data and Information**: Keep it secure.
* **Devices**: PCs, mobile phones, etc.
* **Accounts and Identities**: Passwords, logins.

***

#### **Why It Matters**

The model **makes roles clear**:

* You know what’s on your plate.
* Providers know what’s on theirs.

#### **How to Learn This Quickly**

1. **Picture It**: Visualize the levels as homes:
   * **On-Premises**: Own everything.
   * **IaaS**: Rent land, build the house.
   * **PaaS**: Rent a furnished house.
   * **SaaS**: Rent a hotel room.
2. **Chunk It**: Learn one service at a time (e.g., focus on IaaS today).
3. **Explain to a Friend**: Pretend you’re teaching someone else—this locks it in.
4. **Use Quick Mnemonics**:
   * **IaaS**: "Infrastructure = You Install Apps."
   * **PaaS**: "Platform = Provider’s OS, You Add Apps."
   * **SaaS**: "Software = Sit back and Subscribe."

#### **Key Takeaway**

The **Shared Responsibility Model** splits work so you and the provider know exactly who secures what. Keep your data, devices, and accounts safe, no matter the service.
