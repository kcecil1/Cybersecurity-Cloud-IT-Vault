# Describe governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) concepts

Let’s make this ADHD-friendly with clear, engaging points and simple analogies.

***

#### **Big Idea: What is GRC?**

**Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** helps organizations manage:

1. **Rules**: Governance.
2. **Threats**: Risk.
3. **Laws**: Compliance.

#### **GRC Breakdown**

1. **Governance: The Rulebook**
   * **What It Is**: The system of rules, practices, and processes that control activities.
   * **Key Idea**: Defines "who, what, where, when" for accessing resources.
   * **Example**: A company policy that says only certain employees can access sensitive files for a limited time.
   * **Analogy**: Governance is the playbook for running a sports team—who plays, what they do, and how they do it.
2. **Risk: Managing Threats**
   * **What It Is**: Identifying, assessing, and responding to potential problems.
   * **Key Idea**: Risks come from outside (e.g., hackers, economic changes) and inside (e.g., data leaks, fraud).
   * **Example**: A company creating a plan for handling cybersecurity attacks.
   * **Analogy**: Risk management is like preparing for a storm—checking weather forecasts, building strong defenses, and having emergency plans.
3. **Compliance: Following the Laws**
   * **What It Is**: Meeting legal and regulatory requirements.
   * **Key Idea**: Covers rules about protecting data and penalties for failing to comply.
   * **Example**: Following GDPR to protect customer privacy.
   * **Analogy**: Compliance is like obeying traffic laws—you follow the rules to avoid tickets (penalties).

#### **Compliance-Related Concepts**

1. **Data Residency**: Rules about where data is stored or moved.
   * **Example**: European data must stay in Europe.
2. **Data Sovereignty**: Data must follow the laws of the country where it’s stored.
   * **Example**: U.S.-stored data follows U.S. laws, even if collected elsewhere.
3. **Data Privacy**: Transparency about how personal data is collected, used, and shared.
   * **Example**: Telling users what info you collect and asking for permission.

***

#### **Key GRC Insights**

* **Governance** = Framework to control activities.
* **Risk** = Preparing for and reducing threats.
* **Compliance** = Legal rules for data protection and processes.
* Compliance and security are related but **not the same**:
  * Compliance = Meet legal standards.
  * Security = Broader effort to protect data and systems.

***

#### **How to Remember This**

1. **Chunk It**: Focus on one (Governance, Risk, or Compliance) per day.
2. **Mnemonics**:
   * **GRC = Govern Rules Carefully.**
3. **Visualize**: Picture GRC as a team:
   * **Governance**: The coach.
   * **Risk**: The defense players.
   * **Compliance**: The referee ensuring rules are followed.

***

#### **Key Takeaway**

GRC is the system that keeps organizations running smoothly:

* **Governance** makes the rules.
* **Risk management** guards against problems.
* **Compliance** ensures legal and regulatory requirements are met.
