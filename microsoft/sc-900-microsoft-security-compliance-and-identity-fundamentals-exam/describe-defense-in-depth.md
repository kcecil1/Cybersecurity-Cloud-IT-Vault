# Describe defense in depth

Let’s break this into ADHD-friendly chunks with relatable analogies and focus tools:

***

#### **Big Idea: What is Defense in Depth?**

* **Layered Security**: Think of security like an onion—multiple layers, so if one fails, the next protects you.
* **Goal**: Slow attackers down, block them, and protect sensitive data.

***

#### **Layers of Defense (Each One Adds Protection)**

1. **Physical Security**: Lock the building (e.g., restrict access to the datacenter).
2. **Identity & Access Controls**: ID checks (e.g., passwords + multifactor authentication).
3. **Perimeter Security**: Guard the gates (e.g., DDoS protection for networks).
4. **Network Security**: Divide and conquer (e.g., segment networks to limit resource access).
5. **Compute Security**: Close doors (e.g., secure access to virtual machines and block unused ports).
6. **Application Security**: Clean the house (e.g., secure apps and patch vulnerabilities).
7. **Data Security**: Guard the treasure (e.g., encryption and access controls for sensitive data).

#### **CIA Triad: The Foundation of Cybersecurity**

* **Confidentiality**: Keep secrets safe.
  * Example: Encrypt passwords or customer data.
  * Analogy: Locking your diary so no one reads it.
* **Integrity**: Keep data correct and untampered.
  * Example: Ensure a message you send isn’t altered before delivery.
  * Analogy: Sealing a letter so no one can change it before it’s opened.
* **Availability**: Keep data accessible to those who need it.
  * Example: Ensure customer service reps can access customer data quickly.
  * Analogy: Having a spare key for your house so you’re never locked out.

#### **Why It Matters**

* Cybercriminals want to break **one** layer. You make it hard by adding more.
* Example: Even if someone steals your password, multifactor authentication stops them.

#### **How to Remember This**

1. **Visualize**: Picture a castle with layers of defenses—walls, guards, moats, locked doors.
2. **Chunk It**: Memorize 1–2 layers at a time (e.g., today: perimeter & data security).
3. **Use Mnemonics**:
   * **D for Defense = Don’t rely on one layer.**
   * **CIA = Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability = Keep Secrets Safe, Correct, and Accessible.**
4. **Explain It to Someone**: Teach a friend about the "onion" strategy of security.

#### **Key Takeaway**

**Defense in Depth = Layered Security**. It ensures attackers can’t win with just one breach, and it aligns with the CIA triad to protect data and systems. Think layers, and you’ll remember it!
