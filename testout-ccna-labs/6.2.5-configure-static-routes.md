# 6.2.5 Configure Static Routes

Your branch office is connected to the main office and the internet through the SFO router. Both serial interfaces connecting the SFO router to the main office and the internet have been configured and are up. You need to configure static routes on the SFO router for each destination. Use the next hop address when assigning the static routes. Your ISP's address is 160.12.99.1. Use the show cdp neighbors detail command to discover the next hop address for the 10.0.0.0 network.

In this lab, your task is to:

* Configure a static route to 10.0.0.0/8 network.
* Configure a default route to the internet.
* Save your changes to the startup-config file.

Buckle up because we‚Äôre diving into this CCNA lab like it‚Äôs a game where YOU are the network wizard saving the office (and the world) from disconnected chaos. üöÄ Let‚Äôs get those routers talking and the packets flowing.

### üõ†Ô∏è Lab: Configuring Static Routes on SFO Router

You‚Äôll configure:

1. A static route to reach the 10.0.0.0/8 network.
2. A default route to send traffic to the internet.
3. Save your work so it doesn‚Äôt poof into thin air when the router reboots.

***

#### **Step 1: Get Into the Router**

Picture this: you‚Äôre about to speak to the heart of your network (the CLI). Let‚Äôs log in to the SFO router.

```bash
Router> enable
Router# configure terminal
```

**Why?** You‚Äôre entering the router‚Äôs inner sanctum (privileged EXEC mode) to make changes.

#### **Step 2: Configure a Static Route to the 10.0.0.0 Network**

Think of static routes as a treasure map. You‚Äôre telling the SFO router where to send packets destined for 10.0.0.0/8.

1.  Find the next-hop address:

    ```bash
    Router# show cdp neighbors detail
    ```

    Look for the **IP address** of the device leading to the 10.0.0.0 network (likely the LAX router).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (25) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

_<mark style="color:red;background-color:blue;">**I had to ask Chat GPT how to enter into configure mode**</mark>_

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (26) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

1.  Add the static route:

    ```bash
    Router(config)# ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 <NEXT_HOP_IP>
    ```

    Replace `<NEXT_HOP_IP>` with the IP you found in the previous step (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

**Why?** Without this route, the SFO router would stare blankly when packets for 10.0.0.0 come knocking.

_<mark style="color:red;background-color:blue;">**This didn't work for me because I tried to add the /30 at the end of the IP. I exited out of config mode, pinged the lax ip, then went back into config terminal and then set IP route without adding the /30 at the end.**</mark>_&#x20;

***

#### **Step 3: Configure a Default Route to the Internet**

This is the ‚Äúcatch-all‚Äù route. If the router doesn‚Äôt know where to send traffic, it sends it to the internet.

```bash
Router(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 160.12.99.1
```

**Why?** In real life, default routes make your network internet-savvy, like the GPS for everything ‚Äúnot in the known map.‚Äù

***

#### **Step 4: Verify Your Work**

Time to check if the magic worked. Run these commands:

1.  **See the routing table:**

    ```bash
    Router# show ip route
    ```

    Look for:

    * A static route to 10.0.0.0/8.
    * A default route (`0.0.0.0/0`).

1.  **Test connectivity:**

    ```bash
    Router# ping 10.0.0.1
    Router# ping 8.8.8.8
    ```

    Replace IPs as needed. If you get replies, you‚Äôre golden.

**Why?** Verification saves you from future troubleshooting headaches.

***

#### **Step 5: Save Your Configuration**

You‚Äôve done the work; now save it like a responsible engineer.

```bash
Router# copy running-config startup-config
```

**Why?** If the router reboots and your config isn‚Äôt saved, it‚Äôs back to square one. Trust me, no one wants that.

_<mark style="color:red;background-color:blue;">**You have to type exit to exit the config mode before saving**</mark>_

#### üìù **Common Pitfalls (Avoid These Traps!)**

1. **Wrong Next-Hop IP:** Double-check it with `show cdp neighbors detail`.
2. **Forgetting the Default Route:** No default route means no internet.
3. **Not Saving Config:** All your hard work will disappear. Don‚Äôt skip this!

***

#### üéâ **Wrap-Up**

* You configured a static route and a default route.
* You verified your changes.
* You saved your work. Gold star for you! üåü

Great job today! You‚Äôre one step closer to CCNA domination. Keep going‚Äîyou‚Äôve got this! üí™
