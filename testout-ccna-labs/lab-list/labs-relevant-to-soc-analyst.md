# Labs relevant to SOC Analyst

If your goal is to transition into both **penetration testing** and **SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst** roles, some overlap exists, but a SOC analyst's role focuses more on **monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents**. While pen testing is about attacking and exploiting vulnerabilities, SOC work is about defending, monitoring, and investigating.

#### **Additional CCNA Labs Relevant to SOC Analysts**

To enhance your SOC analyst skills, focus on labs that cover **monitoring, troubleshooting, incident response, and secure configurations**. Below are the **SOC-specific labs** that would complement the pen testing labs:

***

**Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting (3.0, 6.0, 9.0, 11.0)**

* **3.6.4**: Explore CDP\
  (Useful for discovering and identifying devices in a network.)
* **6.3.9**: Find Routing Table Information\
  (Critical for understanding how data flows across the network.)
* **6.5.7**: Explore TCP/IP Communications\
  (Deep dive into packet-level data for incident analysis.)
* **9.8.5–9.8.7**: Optimize Wireless Networks and Troubleshoot Problems\
  (Analyze issues and resolve problems in wireless networks.)
* **11.7.4–11.7.6**: Find VLAN Information and Troubleshoot VLANs\
  (Diagnose and resolve misconfigurations or attacks involving VLANs.)

***

**Access Control and Secure Configurations (12.0, 14.0)**

* **12.2.10–12.2.12**: Configure Allowed Networks, Create Access List Statements, Block Invalid Addresses\
  (Understanding ACLs is key for SOC analysts to ensure secure network segmentation.)
* **14.3.14–14.3.16**: Harden a Switch, Secure Access to a Switch (1–2)\
  (Lock down devices to prevent unauthorized access.)
* **14.5.8**: Counter Malware with Windows Defender\
  (A basic malware analysis lab that aligns with SOC tasks.)
* **14.6.7**: Filter and Analyze Traffic with Wireshark\
  (Wireshark is a SOC analyst's go-to tool for network traffic analysis.)
* **14.7.6**: Capture HTTP POST Packets with Wireshark\
  (SOC analysts frequently analyze web traffic for malicious activity.)
* **14.8.6–14.8.8**: Analyze ICMP Traffic and DDoS Attacks\
  (SOC analysts must understand patterns of DDoS and other attack types.)

***

**Network Management and Redundancy (13.0)**

* **13.9.5**: Configure HSRP\
  (Understanding High Availability is key for ensuring business continuity and disaster recovery.)

***

**SOC-Specific Skills Not Covered in Pen Testing Labs**

1. **Incident Detection and Response:**
   * Labs involving **Wireshark**, **DHCP snooping**, and traffic filtering are particularly valuable for analyzing and responding to incidents.
2. **Malware and Traffic Analysis:**
   * Labs like **14.5.8** (Counter Malware with Windows Defender) and **14.7.6** (Analyze HTTP POST) emphasize real-time analysis and detection of malicious activities.
3. **Network Troubleshooting:**
   * Skills like reviewing routing tables, monitoring TCP/IP communications, and troubleshooting VLANs directly align with a SOC analyst's daily responsibilities.

#### **Overlap Between Pen Testing and SOC Analyst Labs**

These labs are equally important for both roles:

* **14.5.5–14.5.7**: Open Port Detection (Nmap, netstat)
* **14.6.6**: MAC Address Spoofing
* **14.6.7**: Traffic Analysis with Wireshark
* **12.1.8–12.1.10**: Access Control List Labs
* **14.8.6–14.8.8**: DDoS Analysis and ICMP Traffic

***

#### **Key Labs Missing from Pen Testing Path (SOC Analyst-Specific)**

1. **13.9.5**: Configure HSRP (High Availability)
2. **14.5.8**: Counter Malware with Windows Defender
3. **3.6.4**: Explore CDP (Device Discovery)
4. **6.3.9**: Find Routing Table Information
5. **9.8.5–9.8.7**: Wireless Troubleshooting Labs

***

#### **Conclusion**

While there's significant overlap between the two roles, becoming a SOC analyst requires a stronger focus on **monitoring tools**, **traffic analysis**, and **incident response**, whereas pen testing focuses more on exploiting vulnerabilities. If you're preparing for both roles, make sure to include the additional **SOC-specific labs** mentioned above to complement your pen testing skills.
