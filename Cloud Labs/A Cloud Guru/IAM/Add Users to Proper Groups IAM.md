Permission Policy for ec2-admin User Group

{ "Version": "2012-10-17", "Statement": \[ { "Action": \[ "ec2:Describe\*", "ec2:StartInstances", "ec2:StopInstances" ], "Resource": "_", "Effect": "Allow" }, { "Action": "elasticloadbalancing:Describe_", "Resource": "_", "Effect": "Allow" }, { "Action": \[ "cloudwatch:ListMetrics", "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics", "cloudwatch:Describe_" ], "Resource": "_", "Effect": "Allow" }, { "Action": "autoscaling:Describe_", "Resource": "\*", "Effect": "Allow" } ] }

Imagine this JSON code is like a set of magical powers that you're giving to a group of superhero assistants called the "ec2-admin User Group." Let’s break down what these powers are and how they work!

#### Overview

This "Permission Policy" is like a _magical scroll_ that grants specific powers to the group, telling them what they _can_ do (what spells they can cast) and where they can use them (who they can cast them on).

The policy has a version, which is like saying this is the 2012 edition of the spellbook ("Version": "2012-10-17"). The real action happens inside the `"Statement"` section — it's like a to-do list of different magical powers!

Now, let’s dive into each of these magic spells they get to use:

#### Power #1: EC2 Wizardry 🖥✨

* **Action**: `"ec2:Describe*"` 🗺️
  * This is like giving your assistants a magical crystal ball to look at all the EC2 instances and tell you what’s up! They get the power to _see_ everything going on with EC2 instances.
* **Action**: `"ec2:StartInstances"` 🚀
  * Boom! They can bring an EC2 instance _to life_, like using a "wake up" spell.
* **Action**: `"ec2:StopInstances"` 🛑
  * If an instance is misbehaving, they can put it to sleep — a "rest spell" to stop it.
* **Resource**: `"*"` 🌍
  * They can do this magic on _any_ EC2 instance anywhere in your cloud kingdom.
* **Effect**: `"Allow"` ✅
  * You’re saying _yes_, they can totally do this magic.

#### Power #2: Load Balancer Lookout 🏋️‍♂️🔍

* **Action**: `"elasticloadbalancing:Describe*"` 🤓
  * They can _examine_ anything related to load balancing, like a watchful guardian keeping tabs on the traffic flow of your cloud.
* **Resource**: `"*"` 🌐
  * They can use this on _any_ load balancer.
* **Effect**: `"Allow"` 🟢
  * Again, this is _allowed_. They’ve got the thumbs up!

#### Power #3: CloudWatch Fortune Teller 📊🔮

* **Action**: `"cloudwatch:ListMetrics"` 📜
  * They can see _all the metrics_, which is like looking at a big stats board showing how different parts of the system are doing.
* **Action**: `"cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics"` 📈
  * They can dig deeper and _analyze_ those metrics, like checking your speed stats during a race.
* **Action**: `"cloudwatch:Describe*"` 📖
  * This power lets them _describe_ all the monitoring stuff, like knowing all the names of the players on the field.
* **Resource**: `"*"` 🌌
  * They can look at all CloudWatch metrics across the whole cloud galaxy.
* **Effect**: `"Allow"` ✅
  * Yup, this is allowed.

#### Power #4: Auto Scaling Detective 🔍📦

* **Action**: `"autoscaling:Describe*"` 🚀
  * This power is all about peeking at the _Auto Scaling_ details, so your assistants can see how things are scaling up or down in the cloud.
* **Resource**: `"*"` 🌍
  * They can do this for any and all auto-scaling groups.
* **Effect**: `"Allow"` ✅
  * They are totally allowed to investigate and learn all the auto-scaling things!

#### Summary

Imagine the "ec2-admin User Group" as your team of adventurers who are equipped with specific spells to help manage the cloud village:

1. **Look and Control EC2 Instances**: They can _watch_, _start_, and _stop_ instances.
2. **Monitor Load Balancers**: They can check on how well the load balancers are juggling traffic.
3. **Consult the Metrics Oracle**: They have deep insights into CloudWatch, like a fortune teller who can see all the metrics.
4. **Scale Watcher**: They’re on the lookout for how the kingdom scales its resources automatically.

Every power they have is allowed to be used anywhere, so they are pretty much wizards who can see, manage, and monitor all aspects of EC2, load balancers, CloudWatch, and auto-scaling.

Hopefully, this magical adventure made it fun and easier to understand! 🧙‍♂️✨
