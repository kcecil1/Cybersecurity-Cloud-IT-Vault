### **Situation:**
In my current role, I regularly work with high-voltage equipment, including 480V panels. Ensuring electrical safety is critical to prevent accidents and maintain compliance with safety standards. Although I am not required to perform live work myself, I am responsible for ensuring the safety of the team during electrical troubleshooting and commissioning activities.

### **Task:**
My task is to ensure that proper safety procedures are followed during troubleshooting or commissioning of high-voltage panels. This includes implementing Lock Out Tag Out (LOTO) procedures, setting up barricades, and coordinating with licensed electricians when live work is required.

### **Action:**
When working with 480V panels, such as when I was troubleshooting the 480V motor issue, we followed strict electrical safety procedures. First, we powered down the panel and implemented the Lock Out Tag Out (LOTO) procedure to ensure that no one could accidentally re-energize the system. We placed a tag and placard on the panel indicating who locked it out, the date, and the reason for the lockout.

For initial commissioning of the 480V panels, we used barricades and placards to isolate the area, ensuring that only authorized personnel, such as licensed electricians with proper PPE, could access the panels. We adhere to these procedures strictly to avoid unnecessary risk.

### **Result:**
By following these electrical safety protocols, weâ€™ve consistently avoided accidents or injuries during high-voltage panel work. This approach has not only ensured compliance with electrical safety standards but also provided a safe working environment for everyone involved. My attention to these safety measures has contributed to a flawless safety record in our projects, minimizing risks while keeping operations running smoothly.
