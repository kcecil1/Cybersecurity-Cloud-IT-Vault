### **Situation:**
In my current role, I am responsible for training contractors on mechanical safety procedures, especially when working with lifts or performing mechanical and electrical installation tasks. We often work at heights, which requires additional safety precautions. Ensuring that proper mechanical safety measures are followed is critical to preventing accidents.

### **Task:**
My task is to ensure that contractors are trained to use the correct safety equipment and follow safe practices during maintenance and troubleshooting, particularly when working at heights or under potentially hazardous equipment. This includes using harnesses, safety chains with D-shackles, and proper isolation procedures to prevent accidents.

### **Action:**
I regularly train contractors on the use of safety chains and D-shackles to rig lifts in place, preventing them from falling while work is being done underneath. For lifts with load-handling devices, such as forks, I instruct contractors to extend the forks into shelving when working below the lift, ensuring that the lift will be caught by the shelving in the event of brake failure or mechanical failure. 

Additionally, I enforce the use of harnesses whenever we are working above 6 feet, ensuring that everyone is properly secured to prevent falls. I also ensure that power is isolated before any work begins, following lockout procedures so no one can accidentally actuate the lifts during maintenance. To further enhance safety, we wear Level IV Kevlar gloves and sleeves when performing mechanical or electrical tasks in the workcells to prevent injuries from sharp or exposed components.

### **Result:**
Thanks to these safety measures, we have maintained an excellent safety record, with no incidents related to lift work or falls. The contractors Iâ€™ve trained feel confident in their ability to perform their tasks safely, and the use of harnesses, safety chains, and isolation procedures has become a standard part of our operations. These practices ensure that both our team and our customers experience smooth, safe project execution with minimal risk of accidents.
