My experience with SCADA systems can be a transferrable skill towards Building Management Systems (BMS) or Building Automation Systems (BAS), as they both involve monitoring, controlling, and optimizing system operations.
### **Situation:**
In the past and currently, I have worked extensively with Ignition SCADA to monitor and control various automation systems. These included monitoring bots on multiple levels of our structure, lift cells, and robotic inbound and outbound cells. The system provided critical data to ensure smooth operations across our automated processes.

### **Task:**
My task was to configure, monitor, and manage the SCADA systems to ensure that the equipment operated smoothly and without downtime. This included adjusting HMI menus, setting alarms, and resolving any issues in real time to prevent operational delays that could affect productivity.

### **Action:**
In addition to performing my regular duties, I went above and beyond by customizing the HMI menus and alarms to provide more detailed and actionable data to the maintenance teams. For example, I reconfigured the alarm settings to give maintenance alarms and interlocks descriptions, allowing them to proactively address problems before they escalated (often times interlocks were not included on HMIs or were missing tag names, so I would add those, even though I was not expected to, if I noticed while troubleshooting a system). I also set up configurations on new HMIs for SCADA to provide a clearer visual representation of system health across the structure at warehouses and for workcells, making it easier for team members to monitor all areas at a glance.

### **Result:**
As a result of these efforts, system downtime was significantly reduced, and the operations teams were able to react more quickly to potential issues. My adjustments to the HMI and alarm settings contributed to smoother daily operations and improved overall system reliability. Both at my current employer and previous, these improvements directly benefited the customer by minimizing disruptions and ensuring that automated processes ran efficiently.
