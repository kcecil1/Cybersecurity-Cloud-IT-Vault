### **Situation:**
At my previous job, I was tasked with performing preventive maintenance (P.M.) checks on all the UPS systems at the facility. The primary goal was to ensure the UPS systems were functioning properly and that their batteries were still operational.

### **Task:**
I was only required to check whether the batteries were good or bad, but I realized that this process could be improved, especially with battery age tracking, which would help prevent unexpected failures. Batteries without proper records could lead to downtime or system failures for the customer.

### **Action:**
I went beyond the initial task by not only checking the status of the batteries but also examining the date of each battery. For those that were missing dates, I looked up the serial numbers in our database and checked the manufacturing dates to determine the age of the batteries. After gathering all the data, I labeled each battery with accessible and clear expiration information, so anyone could quickly identify if a battery needed to be replaced. I proactively replaced old batteries and placed orders for replacements where we didnâ€™t have stock.

### **Result:**
By implementing this system, I ensured that the UPS systems had updated batteries, reducing the risk of unexpected failures and improving system reliability for the customer. This process reduced downtime risks and made future maintenance quicker and easier for the team. The customer saw an improvement in system uptime, and the facility experienced zero power interruptions related to UPS failure during my tenure.
