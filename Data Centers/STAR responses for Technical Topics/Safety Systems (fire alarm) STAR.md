### **Situation:**
In my current role, I work with safety systems daily, particularly in environments involving self-driving forklift bots and robot arm work cells. Safety is paramount, and any failure in the system could lead to significant injury risks or damage to equipment. I’m responsible for setting up and configuring these systems to ensure maximum safety.

### **Task:**
I was tasked with commissioning fortress safety doors and configuring safety PLCs for both our self-driving forklifts and robotic arm work cells. Additionally, I needed to ensure that safety torque signals, overtravel limits, and other critical safety measures were properly integrated into the system. Beyond this, I was responsible for training contractors on safe operating procedures for lifts and ensuring that they understood how to rig equipment safely and avoid accidents.

### **Action:**
I went beyond the basic requirements by not only setting up the safety systems but also performing extensive testing and verification of each program. I set up Safety IO link modules to capture critical signals, configured safety PLCs, deployed safety programs, and tested everything to ensure no faults or risks were left unresolved. On top of this, I provided hands-on training for contractors, specifically showing them how to rig safety chains on lifts and use material handling lifts in a way that prevents accidents. I made sure they understood how to extend the load handling units into the shelves so that if the brakes were to release or fail, the lifts would catch on the shelves, avoiding a potential disaster.

### **Result:**
As a result of my thorough setup, testing, and contractor training, we’ve maintained a flawless safety record in the areas I’ve been responsible for. There have been no incidents of equipment failure or injury related to the safety systems, and the contractors have expressed greater confidence in their ability to work safely thanks to my training. My attention to detail and commitment to safety ensured that all operations ran smoothly, even in high-risk environments, benefiting both the customer and the project.
