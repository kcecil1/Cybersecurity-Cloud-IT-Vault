If I were tasked with troubleshooting an issue related to wet bulb and dry bulb temperature monitoring, I would approach it methodically. First, I would begin by checking the monitoring system ( either BAS, scada dashboard, HMI or PLC code) to isolate the issue more quickly.

Then, inspecting the sensors responsible for monitoring both temperatures. I would ensure that they are properly connected and receiving accurate readings, as sensor malfunction could lead to improper temperature and humidity control. 

I would then check the electrical wiring, including connections to the thermocouples, to verify there are no loose or faulty wires causing inaccurate readings. Since I’ve had experience rewiring a few thermocouple panels in the past, I believe I can figure out how to ensure they’re properly set up for accurate temperature measurement. 

Next, I would recalibrate the sensors if necessary, ensuring that they are correctly aligned with the environmental conditions to provide accurate wet and dry bulb readings. This would involve testing the system’s response to changes in temperature and humidity, making sure it can adjust cooling as needed to maintain optimal conditions. 

Lastly, I would review the control system settings to ensure that the cooling system is responding appropriately based on the sensor data. Adjusting the system’s thresholds for humidity and temperature control would help prevent any overheating of equipment, ensuring smooth and efficient operations. 

While I haven’t dealt specifically with wet bulb and dry bulb monitoring in my past roles, my experience with electrical troubleshooting furnaces and thermocouples, has provided me with a solid foundation for addressing similar challenges in temperature-sensitive environments. I've also worked with PID loops but more so with level, pressure and flow sensors in water treatment.
