### **Situation:**
Recently, I was called to troubleshoot a lift motor in Texas that was repeatedly blowing its brake fuses. The issue was causing frequent downtime in the production line, impacting the customer’s ability to meet their deadlines.

### **Task:**
My task was to diagnose and resolve the issue with the lift motor, which was critical for the customer’s operations. I needed to identify the root cause and ensure the system could run reliably, minimizing further production delays.

### **Action:**
I systematically went through a series of checks to isolate the problem. First, I checked the motor cable’s resistance and for any ground faults, as well as the pinout of the cables and connectors. Then, I checked the brake rectifier and brake wire resistance values, along with the brake gap, which was too tight. I had a mechanic adjust the brake gap, allowing the lift to run temporarily.

I took the additional step of using a megohmmeter to measure the motor's insulation resistance, and found it was only 1.1 megohms, compared to a known good motor at 2.2 gigaohms. I theorized that the tight brake gap had caused the motor to overheat, blowing the brake fuses and damaging the insulation. I documented my findings in detail in Jira and advised the production and maintenance leads that the motor would likely need to be replaced. Unfortunately, despite my recommendation, they chose not to replace the motor right away.

### **Result:**
Two weeks later, after continued issues, the motor failed completely, and it was eventually replaced, confirming my initial diagnosis. Although the customer didn’t act on my suggestion immediately, the thorough documentation I provided in Jira saved time when they revisited the issue. My early intervention minimized further troubleshooting down the line and demonstrated my ability to proactively diagnose issues and provide actionable recommendations that ensure long-term system reliability.
