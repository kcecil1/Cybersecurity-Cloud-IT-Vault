### **Situation:**
In my current role, I regularly work with 480V panels and automated workcells, where strict adherence to Lock Out Tag Out (LOTO) procedures is critical to ensure the safety of everyone involved. Additionally, I am responsible for training and onboarding contractors who need to follow LOTO procedures while working in our facility.

### **Task:**
My task is to ensure that all energy sources are properly isolated before maintenance or troubleshooting work is performed. I also take on the responsibility of training contractors to understand and implement LOTO procedures effectively, as any mistakes could result in serious injury or equipment damage.

### **Action:**
In addition to strictly following LOTO procedures, I have contributed to comprehensive training for new contractors. This includes hands-on demonstrations, clear documentation, and real-world scenarios to reinforce the importance of LOTO compliance. I ensure that every contractor understands how to safely isolate energy sources and follow the appropriate tagging and locking procedures. I also conduct regular checks to ensure compliance and update the program as needed to reflect any new safety regulations or changes in our systems.

### **Result:**
As a result of my efforts, we have maintained a perfect safety record with no LOTO-related incidents with my fellow team members that work directly with me. Contractors have consistently expressed confidence in their ability to safely perform their tasks, thanks to the training I provide. By ensuring compliance with LOTO procedures, Iâ€™ve helped minimize the risk of accidents, creating a safer work environment and maintaining uninterrupted operations for our customers.
