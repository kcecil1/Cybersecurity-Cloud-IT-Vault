### **Scenario 1: Troubleshooting Lift Motor with Blown Fuses**

**Situation:**  
At one of my previous jobs, I was tasked with troubleshooting a 480V lift motor that was repeatedly blowing brake fuses, causing production downtime. The standard task would have been to simply replace the fuses and get the motor running by fixing what ever issues there were with the brake.

**Action:**  
Instead of just replacing the fuses, I took the time to systematically diagnose the underlying issue. I checked for ground faults, shorts in the motor cable, and measured the resistance of the brake rectifier and brake wiring. Then, using a megohmmeter, I discovered that the motor's insulation had degraded due to overheating. I identified that the brake gap was too tight, causing the motor to overheat and blow fuses. Even though it wasnâ€™t my responsibility, I worked with the mechanic to adjust the brake gap, and documented everything in Jira for future reference, and also reported the low resistance readings for the motor's insulation and that the motor would have to be replaced soon, and documented this as well - in JIRA and copied all known stakeholders. The motor ended up quitting entirely 2 weeks later and had to be replaced.

**Result:**  
My proactive approach prevented further unnecessary troubleshooting and helped pinpoint the root cause of the problem. Despite initial reluctance from the production leads to replace the motor, my thorough documentation and persistence ensured the issue was resolved permanently. My actions saved the company further downtime and costs that would have resulted from repeated motor failures, ultimately improving system reliability.
