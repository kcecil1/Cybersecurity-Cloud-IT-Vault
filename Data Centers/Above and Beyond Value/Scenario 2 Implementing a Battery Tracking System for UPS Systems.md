### **Scenario 2: Implementing a Battery Tracking System for UPS Systems**

**Situation:**  
In a previous role, I was responsible for routine preventive maintenance (P.M.) of UPS systems, where my task was to simply check if the batteries were still functional. However, I saw an opportunity to improve the process for long-term benefits.

**Action:**  
I went beyond the scope of my job by not only checking the current status of the batteries but also looking up the manufacturing and installation dates for each battery. For batteries that were missing this information, I retrieved it from the database and labeled them clearly with expiration dates. Additionally, I replaced old batteries and ordered replacements for any that were nearing their expiration. I also ensured that future technicians could easily identify battery status by implementing an organized labeling system.

**Result:**  
My initiative helped prevent unexpected UPS failures by ensuring that batteries were properly tracked and replaced before they could cause system disruptions. This reduced downtime and improved overall system reliability for the company, saving both time and resources in the long run. My attention to detail also made future maintenance faster and more efficient for my team.
