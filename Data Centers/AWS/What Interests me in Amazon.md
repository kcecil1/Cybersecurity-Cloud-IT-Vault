What interests me about Amazon and the Data Center Engineering Operations team is the scale and complexity of the systems you work with. I’ve spent years troubleshooting and commissioning controls automation systems, and I find a great deal of satisfaction in diving deep into problems, ensuring everything is functioning at the highest standard. Working with Amazon means being at the forefront of technology, and I'm excited by the opportunity to apply my skills to maintain and optimize mission-critical infrastructure, especially within such a data-intensive environment.

I’m particularly drawn to the challenge of ensuring continuous uptime and the reliability of systems that impact so many people worldwide. The idea of working on such large-scale projects is both intimidating and exhilarating, and it's that type of challenge that drives me to grow. I'm also fascinated by the integration of safety systems and redundancy in data centers—my background in safety PLCs and fortress safety systems aligns closely with Amazon's focus on resiliency and redundancy, which I find intriguing.

Moreover, I’m interested in learning from Amazon's culture of ownership, high standards, and customer obsession. I believe my commissioning and troubleshooting experience in controls automation systems will be transferable to working with building management systems (BMS) at data centers, and I want to take the next step towards mastering the unique challenges of data center operations. I thrive on taking responsibility, solving complex issues, and continuously learning, all of which seem to align perfectly with Amazon's mission and the goals of this team.
