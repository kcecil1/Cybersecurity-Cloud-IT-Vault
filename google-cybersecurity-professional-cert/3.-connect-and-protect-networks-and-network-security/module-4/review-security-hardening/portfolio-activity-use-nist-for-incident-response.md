### **Mission Overview: Save the Company!** 🛡️

You’re a **cybersecurity analyst** working for a cool **multimedia company** that just got hit by a **DDoS attack**. The company’s services, like web design and social media marketing, were down for two hours due to a flood of ICMP packets. Yikes!

The attack exposed a weak spot in your firewall, so it’s up to you to use your **NIST CSF** skills to:
1. **Analyze** what went wrong.
2. **Protect** the company from future attacks.
3. **Respond** with a killer action plan.

And guess what? This incident report can go straight into your **cybersecurity portfolio**—talk about leveling up! 🚀

### **The Scenario: What Went Down**

A malicious attacker hit the company with a **DDoS attack** by flooding your network with ICMP pings, exploiting an unconfigured firewall. Your team quickly took action by:
- Blocking incoming ICMP packets
- Stopping non-critical services
- Restoring critical network services

They also tightened security by adding:
- A firewall rule to limit incoming ICMP traffic
- IP address verification to block spoofed addresses
- Network monitoring software
- An IDS/IPS system

Now, it’s your turn to dive deeper into the attack and **analyze** what happened using the **NIST CSF**!
