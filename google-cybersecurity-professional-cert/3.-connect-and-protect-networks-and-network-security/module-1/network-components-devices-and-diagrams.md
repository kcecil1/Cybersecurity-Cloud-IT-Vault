### 🌐 **Network Basics**

- **Network Devices**: Manage the flow of information. Devices communicate by sending **data packets** with info about where they're from and where they're going.
- **The Network**: Like a road system for your devices (computers, phones, etc.). Routers, switches, and other devices help manage traffic.

### 🛠️ **Important Devices**

1. **Router**: The guide! Directs data across networks, based on IP addresses.
2. **Switch**: The traffic cop! Sends data to specific devices on the local network. Smarter than hubs because it doesn’t broadcast data to everyone!
3. **Firewall**: The bodyguard! Monitors and blocks unsafe traffic entering or leaving the network.
4. **Modem**: The translator! Connects your home/office to the internet. Converts signals so they can travel through physical cables.
5. **Wireless Access Point**: The Wi-Fi wizard! Creates a wireless network and sends data via radio waves.

### 🧑‍💻 **Everyday Devices** (PCs, Laptops, Phones, Tablets)

- Each has a **MAC address** (hardware ID) and an **IP address** (location ID).
- Can connect via **wired** or **wireless** networks.
- They **send/receive data packets** using network interfaces.

---

### 🔥 **Firewalls**: The Shield 🛡️

- **Monitors** incoming/outgoing traffic.
- Blocks or allows connections based on **rules**.
- Sits between your **trusted network** and the **wild, wild internet**.

---

### 🗂️ **Servers**: The Library 📚

- Devices that provide info/services to **clients** (like your laptop, phone, etc.).
- Common servers:
    - **DNS** (translates website names into IP addresses).
    - **File servers** (store/retrieve files).
    - **Mail servers** (handle email).

### 💻 **Hubs vs. Switches**: The Traffic Directors 🚦

- **Hubs**: Basic, repeats all info to every device. Makes it easy for others to listen in 👂 (vulnerable).
- **Switches**: Smarter! Only sends data to the **right** device. More secure and faster ⚡.

---

### 🚦 **Routers**: The Roadmap 🌍

- Connects networks and directs traffic using **IP addresses**.
- **Reads** IP info and sends packets along the **correct path** until they reach the destination.
- Often includes **firewall features** for added security.

---

### 🌍 **Modem & Wireless Access Point**: The Gatekeepers 🔑

- **Modem**: Connects to your ISP and translates signals from the internet.
- **Wireless Access Point (Wi-Fi)**: Sends/receives data using radio waves, allowing wireless devices to connect without cables.

### 🗺️ **Network Diagrams: Maps for Security Analysts**

- Visual representation of **how devices connect**.
- **Symbols** represent devices (like routers, switches, etc.).
- **Lines** show how data flows between them.
- Helps analysts plan **better defenses** and spot vulnerabilities.

### 🏁 **Key Takeaways**

- **Client-server model**: Clients request info, servers respond.
- Devices include routers, servers, hubs, switches, and modems.
- **Network diagrams** help visualize and secure network structures.
