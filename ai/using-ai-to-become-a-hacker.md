# Using AI to become a Hacker

**7 Ways I’m Using AI to Crush My Hack the Box CPTS Goals**\
&#xNAN;_&#x53;poiler Alert: I’m basically overdosing on coffee and letting AI be my personal genius tutor._

***

### 1. **The “Why” Factor**

* **Time Crunch**: I have about a thousand hours of CPTS training looming over me, plus I run a business and have six kids. (Yes, six. I’m busy.)
* **Enter AI**: I put all my whys in a Notion page (like “I need to pass or I’ll never sleep again!”) and ask AI to refine them or suggest new ones.
* **Motivation on Demand**: I even made a custom AI block that randomly picks one of my whys to remind me why I’m torturing myself. Instant pep talk!

***

### 2. **Pre-Lesson Quizzes**

* **Paste & Test**: Before I dive into a lesson (like “Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion”), I copy the entire lesson text into Notion or ChatGPT.
* **Pop Quiz, AI**: I say, “Quiz me on this content.” If I bomb the test, AI tells me what I need to study more. If I rock it, I can skip or speed-run the lesson.
* **Customized Feedback**: AI adjusts study plans based on where I’m flailing. Because I don’t have time to wander in the dark.

***

### 3. **AI Summaries**

* **Chunky Notes, Meet AI**: Summaries save me from reading an entire novel of my messy notes.
* **Automatic Bullet Points**: One click in Notion and bam—condensed bullet points that let me see what’s going on in five lines or less.
* **Bird’s-Eye View**: I can quickly see how a topic (like “Nmap firewall evasion”) fits into the bigger hacking puzzle.

***

### 4. **Deeper Understanding (aka “Mind Map Magic”)**

* **Visual Brain Dump**: AI spins my notes into a mind map, letting me see relationships like “Why Sᴇɴd a SYN scan?” or “Where does DNS proxying fit in?”
* **Comparisons**: I ask AI to compare concepts (IDS vs. IPS, SYN vs. ACK) in side-by-side tables.
* **Pitfall Alerts**: “What are the common mistakes newbies make with firewall evasion?” AI warns me so I don’t faceplant.
* **Real-World Use**: I also make AI cough up scenarios—“When would an attacker realistically use a SYN scan?” So I can see how this applies in the wild.

***

### 5. **Voice Chat & Driving Practice**

* **Talk It Out**: I dump text into ChatGPT, open the app on my phone, and ask it to quiz me verbally.
* **Carpool Karaoke**: I literally talk to ChatGPT while driving (hands-free, obviously). It quizzes me, corrects me, and I reply.
* **Immediate Feedback**: No more bugging my spouse about subnets or port knocking. AI is my captive audience.

***

### 6. **Review Q’s & Flashcards**

* **No More “Ugh”**: I hate making flashcards. So I just say, “Hey AI, generate some Q\&A based on these notes.” Done.
* **Flashy Cards**: AI churns out front-back flashcards, so I can import them into Anki for spaced repetition. My memory approves.
* **Grain of Salt**: AI isn’t perfect, but it’s awesome at giving me a jumpstart (like saving me hours of manual card-making).

***

### 7. **Teach It, Own It**

* **Content Ideas**: I ask AI for potential YouTube/short-form/post ideas. Then I script it myself and let AI refine my grammar or point out any cringe.
* **Validation**: If AI thinks I’m missing something, I fix it before I go public. It’s like a tiny editor that actually knows what it’s talking about.
* **Knowledge Lock-In**: The second I teach a concept, it cements into my brain. AI basically helps me avoid misinformation and look smarter than I am.

***

#### **Bonus Round**

1. **Cheat Sheet Generator**
   * AI can produce a quick reference (e.g., “Here are all the must-know Nmap commands”) so I’m not furiously Googling every 5 minutes.
2. **Second Brain with Notion**
   * Notion = my personal database for everything: scripts, kids’ schedules, random life stuff.
   * **Notion Q\&A**: It can answer me using my actual notes—no more generic web searches.
   * Hook up Slack, notes, and everything else. AI references them all. Mind blown.

### **Wrap-Up**

That’s my 7-step AI plan to crush the CPTS exam without ditching my six kids, my job, or my coffee mug. If you’re strapped for time (or just easily distracted like me), let AI handle the grunt work, generate quizzes, and talk you through the tricky bits. Stay caffeinated, keep hacking, and let’s get that cert!

**Good luck and happy AI-studying!**
