# 1.1 Why Ethics? Why Science Fiction?

#### Welcome to the ADHD-Friendly Ethics Adventure! 🎢✨

Let’s dive into _“Why Ethics? Why Science Fiction?”_ in a way that’s engaging, creative, and easy to absorb. Think of this as a journey through a magical theme park, with each learning objective being a different ride or attraction. Buckle up! 🎡

***

#### 🎯 **Learning Objectives as Attractions**

1. **The Ethics Ferris Wheel 🎡**
   * _View from Above:_ Understand **normative vs. descriptive ethics**.
   * Normative ethics is like asking, "What _should_ we do?" (e.g., Should robots replace caregivers?)
   * Descriptive ethics observes, "What _do_ people do?" (e.g., How do societies view robot caregivers today?)
   * Together, these perspectives give a full-circle view of ethical questions.
2. **The Tension Tightrope 🎪**
   * Life is a balancing act! Imagine walking a tightrope with:
     * **Limited resources** pulling you one way (Who gets the tech first?).
     * **Competing goods** pulling the other (Is privacy or security more important?).
     * **Different ideas of ‘good’** wobbling the rope (What one person values may differ for someone else).\
       Stay balanced as we explore these tricky tensions!
3. **The Case Study vs. Sci-Fi Coaster 🎢**
   * Case studies = real-world roller coasters: predictable and based on real events (e.g., ethics in self-driving cars).
   * Science fiction = futuristic thrill rides: creative and "what if?" (e.g., robot uprisings or AI-led utopias).\
     Both take us on a wild ride through ethical thinking—one grounded, one imaginative.
4. **Ethics Hall of Mirrors 🪞**
   * See yourself in two reflections:
     * **Personal ethics:** Your values, like honesty or kindness.
     * **Professional ethics:** Your workplace responsibilities, like writing safe code or respecting data privacy.
   * Both are crucial for navigating the tech funhouse without tripping!

#### 🌟 **The Grand Introduction Show** 🌟

Lights dim, dramatic music plays, and questions start flying like fireworks:

* Should autonomous weapons exist?
* What happens when buggy code is released?
* Can someone hack my bank account with AI?

Boom! 🎆 These questions aren’t just technical—they’re ethical! Tech is powerful, shaping everything from how we talk to how we save lives. But power comes with responsibility. Let’s explore why ethics is the compass guiding us through this storm.

#### 🛠️ **Workshop: Build Your Ethical Toolkit**

Imagine you’re a tech architect. You need tools to make decisions when no one answer is _the_ answer. Here’s your kit:

* **Magnifying Glass 🔍:** Spot the trade-offs (Who benefits? Who’s harmed?).
* **Compass 🧭:** Stay aligned with what matters—your values and society’s rules.
* **Blueprints 📜:** Dream up designs that improve the world while minimizing harm.

#### 🚀 **Science Fiction: Your Ethical Time Machine**

Why use science fiction? Because it’s like strapping into a rocket and exploring the “what-ifs” of tomorrow:

* _Case Study:_ "How did one company handle this issue?"
* _Sci-Fi:_ "What if this tech transformed society? What could go wrong—or right?"

Sci-fi opens doors to conversations about things we haven’t faced yet—like whether AIs should have human rights or if we’d trust a robot babysitter. Cool, huh? 🚀✨

***

#### 🌌 **Reflection Galaxy**

Imagine you’re a cosmic explorer, charting your values and goals in uncharted territory:

* What kind of tech do you want to create?
* How can your designs empower people, not exploit them?
* How will you ensure fairness, safety, and beauty in the systems you build?

The answers aren’t handed to you; you’ll discover them as you navigate this ethics galaxy.

***

#### 🎉 **Final Ride: The Ethics Adventure Never Ends** 🎢

This book isn’t here to tell you _what_ to think but _how_ to think. It’s your ethical treasure map, guiding you to ask better questions and build solutions that matter. Ethics is the ride that never stops—it’s as dynamic as the tech world itself!

Now, go forth and conquer those ethical dilemmas with curiosity, creativity, and compassion. You’ve got this! 🎈✨
