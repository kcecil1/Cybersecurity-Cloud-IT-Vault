# 2.6 CONTEMPORARY DEVELOPMENTS IN ETHICS

Alright, buckle up! We’re going to take a high-speed, ADHD-friendly tour of some of the most exciting new developments in ethics from the last 75-100 years. I'll show you how they work, keep things fun, and apply these concepts to **cybersecurity** so we understand how we can keep the digital world safer, smarter, and more inclusive. 🤖🔐✨

### 🌟 **Contemporary Developments in Ethics: A Modern Take**

Ethical frameworks like **deontology**, **utilitarianism**, **virtue ethics**, and **communitarianism** have been around for ages and have served us well, but the last 100 years have brought **rapid changes**—hello, internet! 👋 That’s why new ethical frameworks have popped up to address **modern challenges**. We’ll explore three of these: **Responsibility Ethics**, **Feminist Ethics**, and the **Capability Approach**.

Think of these like DLC packs that bring new perspectives to the ethical base game—giving us a toolkit to tackle today’s issues, like AI bias, privacy breaches, and cyber warfare. 🎮🛠️

### 🤝 **2.6.1 Responsibility Ethics: Accountability Level-Up!**

Ever feel overwhelmed by all the data and connections around you? **Responsibility Ethics** is here to remind us that in today’s **super-complex** and **interconnected world**, our actions are like throwing stones into a pond—the ripples affect everything!

#### **⚠️ Origin Story: After the Holocaust**

This approach was developed in the wake of **World War II** and the **Holocaust**. People like **Hans Jonas** argued that technology and industrialization had enabled **terrible destruction** on a massive scale. Jonas pointed out that these actions, like transporting people to death camps, had become **efficient** and **removed**—making it easy for people not to think about the consequences.

The takeaway? **Just because you&#x20;**_**can**_**&#x20;do something doesn’t mean you&#x20;**_**should**_**&#x20;do it.** Responsibility Ethics tells us to slow down and think of the consequences, even if we don't see them right away.

#### **😰 Heuristics of Fear: Always Assume the Worst**

Jonas proposed a strategy called **heuristics of fear**—basically, assume the worst-case scenario. It’s like playing a game where you always plan for the biggest boss fight because if you don’t, it could end in disaster. 🎮

#### **🛡️ Cybersecurity Application: Stay Cautious, Always**

In **cybersecurity**, imagine you’re setting up a **firewall** for a corporate network. Responsibility Ethics says you **assume the worst**—a massive **data breach** or a **cyber attack**. You would want to **overprotect**, making sure **no weak points** exist, because if you don’t take the worst-case seriously, the **damage** could be enormous.

### 🌸 **2.6.2 Feminist Ethics: Power to the People (ALL People!)**

Here comes **Feminist Ethics**, like an ethical support hero focusing on the **care and relationships** that keep us all going. 🦸‍♀️✨ It’s a response to the fact that most traditional frameworks were built by and for those in **power**—usually men, who had the resources and social standing to influence how society worked.

#### **🔎 Focus on Care and Emotions**

**Feminist Ethics** aims to repair the **imbalances** of power by focusing on **empathy**, **care**, and the **experiences of marginalized groups**. It looks at how **real-life relationships** and **feelings** can help us make ethical choices, rather than just relying on abstract rules.

#### **🧠 The Concept of Emotional Labor**

Feminist Ethics also gives us the concept of **emotional labor**—jobs where people need to manage their emotions (like customer service). It tells us that emotional labor is **real work** and it should be **valued** accordingly.

#### **🌐 Cybersecurity Application: Addressing Bias**

Let’s apply this to **cybersecurity**. Imagine you’re a developer working on an **AI algorithm** that analyzes hiring data. Feminist Ethics reminds us to **check for biases**—like racial or gender biases that are historically ingrained in datasets. If you ignore them, your algorithm might reinforce **inequality** instead of **reducing it**.

Plus, think about the **emotional labor** of moderators in online spaces who filter **harmful content**. Feminist Ethics would argue that this is **valuable work** that needs proper **recognition** and **support** to prevent burnout. 🚫🔥

### 🌱 **2.6.3 The Capability Approach: Unlocking Everyone’s Full Potential!**

Think of the **Capability Approach** as an ethical power-up that helps people achieve their **potential**—not just in theory, but **in practice**. Developed by **Amartya Sen** and expanded by **Martha Nussbaum**, this approach focuses on giving people **real opportunities** to thrive.

#### **🚀 Capabilities vs. Functionings**

* **Capabilities** are like resources—what you have access to.
* **Functionings** are like abilities—what you can _actually do_ with those resources.

For example, if you have a **bicycle**, that’s a capability. But if there’s **no road to ride on**, it’s not useful. We need to make sure people can actually **use their resources**.

#### **🛠️ Cybersecurity Application: Access for All**

In **cybersecurity**, this might look like ensuring that **everyone** has the **tools and knowledge** to protect themselves online. Giving someone a **password manager** but not explaining how it works isn’t enough—you need to **educate** them on why it’s important and how to use it effectively.

Or, imagine you’re designing an online security feature, like **two-factor authentication (2FA)**. The **Capability Approach** says make sure **everyone** can actually use it—like considering **people with disabilities** who might find it challenging. Designing for **accessibility** makes the internet safer for **everyone**. 🔐🌍

### **🤖 Story Highlights: Ethical Tales in Tech**

#### **📜 “Codename: Delphi” by Linda Nagata**

Karin, the protagonist, is responsible for managing soldiers remotely—telling them when to **take the shot** or **stay safe**. She doesn’t see the battlefield directly, but her decisions impact lives. This story shows how **technology** can **distance us** from the consequences of our actions and why it’s crucial to take **responsibility** for those impacts.

#### **📜 “Today I Am Paul” by Martin L. Shoemaker**

An android cares for **Mildred**, an elderly woman with dementia, by emulating her loved ones. This is a powerful look at **care** relationships and raises questions about **what counts as care**. Feminist Ethics would encourage us to consider if using an android disconnects us from the **emotional responsibility** of caring for loved ones.

#### **📜 “Welcome to Your Authentic Indian Experience™” by Rebecca Roanhorse**

Jesse, the main character, works at a **VR company**, crafting “authentic” American Indian experiences. This story reveals the barriers Jesse faces—**social**, **cultural**, and **economic**—that limit his potential and **capabilities**. The **Capability Approach** helps us understand the importance of removing these barriers to help people **thrive**.

### 🏁 **Concluding Remarks: Multiple Frameworks for Multiple Problems**

Ethical frameworks are like **filters** for a camera 📸—each one gives us a different way of looking at a problem. By using multiple frameworks, like **Responsibility Ethics**, **Feminist Ethics**, and the **Capability Approach**, we can see **complex problems** from different angles and make better choices—especially in the field of **cybersecurity**, where challenges are layered, human, and often **invisible**.
