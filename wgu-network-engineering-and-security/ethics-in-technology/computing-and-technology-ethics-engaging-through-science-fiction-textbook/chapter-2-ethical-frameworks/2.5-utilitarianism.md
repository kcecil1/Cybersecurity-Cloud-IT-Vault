# 2.5 UTILITARIANISM

Alright, let's dive into the exciting world of **Utilitarianism** in a way that's fun, ADHD-friendly, and perfectly connects to **cybersecurity**. Get ready for a journey filled with choices, consequences, and how it all applies to keeping the internet safe. 🛡️💻

***

### **🌟 Utilitarianism: The Ultimate Happiness Hack**

Imagine you’re playing an **open-world game** where every decision you make either makes your crew **happier** or makes them **miserable**. The more happiness you bring to the greatest number of people, the more points you rack up—and this is what **Utilitarianism** is all about! 🤩🎮

It’s all about **maximizing happiness** while trying to minimize pain. When it comes to deciding whether something is the **"right"** thing to do, utilitarians look at the **consequences** of that action. It's like asking yourself, "Does this action make everyone in my group happier?" If yes, you level up ethically!

#### **🏆 The Greatest Happiness Principle**

**John Stuart Mill**, one of the famous names you'll hear a lot in **Utilitarianism**, said that the "right" actions are the ones that **bring the most pleasure** and **reduce the most pain**. That’s called the **Greatest Happiness Principle**. If it sounds like a party planner's rule—make sure everyone’s having fun, and nobody’s crying in the corner—then you’re getting it! 🎉

### **💡 2.5.1 Overview of Utilitarianism: Consequences Are King**

Utilitarianism is part of a broader category called **Consequentialism**—which basically means we care about what happens **after** an action.

* **Whose happiness matters?** 🤔 Not just yours! In utilitarianism, **everyone’s happiness counts equally**. That’s called **Agent-Neutrality**. You don’t get to put yourself in a special category. If you want a cookie, but giving it away makes **more people happy**, you share it. 🍪✨

**Fun Fact**: It’s not just about making the most people happy, but also about making the **best decisions possible** for **everyone involved**, even if it means some folks won’t get what they want. It's like being the ethical "team captain" where you strategize so the **whole team wins**.

***

#### **🚨 Application to Cybersecurity: Balancing Consequences**

Think about **cybersecurity** as defending a castle 🏰 with lots of villagers inside. Your main goal is to keep as many villagers happy (i.e., safe) as possible!

* Imagine there's a new security update for your **network firewall**. You know installing it will make the system temporarily **laggy**, but if you **don’t install it**, everyone’s private data is vulnerable to a **cyber attack**. What do you do? 🤷‍♂️

With utilitarianism in mind, you weigh the consequences:

* **Install the update**: Short-term annoyance, but keeps data safe long-term.
* **Don’t install**: No lag but leaves a **gaping hole** in the defense, leading to **many unhappy customers** if a breach happens.

Utilitarianism says you should definitely install the update because it **maximizes the happiness of everyone** in the long run—even if it means a temporary hiccup.

### **📜 Classical Utilitarianism: Mill & Bentham**

**Jeremy Bentham** and **John Stuart Mill** were the original **philosophical power duo** of Utilitarianism. Imagine them as the **developers** of this ethical game. They wanted to create a system that worked for everyone!

* **Bentham**: Thought about happiness as something you could **calculate**. Imagine a **happiness bar** that just fills up based on the number of good vibes. He didn’t really care what type of happiness it was—if it made you feel good, it counted!
* **Mill**: Took it up a level. He said that **some pleasures are better than others**—like, reading a good book is a "higher pleasure" compared to eating ten donuts, which might make you sick later 🤢📚🍩. Mill wanted us to **think big** and aim for pleasures that **elevate us**.

### **🔄 Preference Utilitarianism: R.M. Hare’s Twist**

Let’s now introduce **R. M. Hare**, the guy who leveled up the utilitarian game to something called **Preference Utilitarianism**.

* Instead of focusing just on **immediate pleasure**, Hare focused on **preferences**—what people _want_ for their **future selves**. It’s like having a save game for the future! 🕹️✨

For instance, in **cybersecurity**, your **future preference** might be to keep all your digital data **private and secure**. Even if you don’t enjoy entering long, complicated passwords right now, you still do it because you know it helps keep your future self happy and safe.

#### **🎤 Voluntary Actions: Actions That Matter Most**

Imagine you’re on a **VR skiing game**, racing downhill, when suddenly you crash into another skier. You didn’t mean to, but the other skier ends up hurt. Here’s the deal: **Utilitarianism** says you’re **not morally responsible** for involuntary actions. You didn't mean to fall and hurt that person—it was out of your control.

In **cybersecurity**, this would be like if a network admin accidentally clicked a **phishing email**. They didn’t mean to compromise the system. As long as it wasn’t **intentional**, utilitarianism cuts them some slack and focuses more on **mitigating the damage** and fixing things.

***

#### **🔢 2.5.6 Calculating the Greatest Good: Rules vs. Actions**

Now, let’s talk about calculating the greatest good without turning into a **head-scratching math problem**!

* **Act Utilitarianism**: It’s about **specific actions**. You look at each **cyber incident** as it comes and decide which response will make **everyone happiest**.
* **Rule Utilitarianism**: Think of this as a **security playbook**—you follow **rules of thumb** that, most of the time, will lead to a great outcome. Instead of calculating every decision from scratch, you know certain **rules** (like always encrypting sensitive data) lead to **greater happiness**.

In **cybersecurity**, we use **Rule Utilitarianism** when we make **policies**. For example:

* "Always enable **multi-factor authentication**" 📱✔️
* "Conduct regular **pen tests** to find vulnerabilities" 🕵️‍♂️💻

These policies are **rules of thumb** designed to bring the greatest good over time without needing individual calculations for every single email or log-in attempt.

### **🏋️‍♂️ Strengths & Weaknesses of Utilitarianism: Pros and Cons in Cybersecurity**

#### **Strengths**:

1. **It’s about everyone**: In **utilitarianism**, you think about what’s best for the **whole network**—no selfish players. 💡
2. **Flexible**: You get to **adapt** to situations. If patching a vulnerability brings **more good** even if it's inconvenient, you do it.

#### **Weaknesses**:

1. **Who counts more?** Sometimes, we need to decide who gets priority. In **cybersecurity**, should **large companies** get extra protections because they have more people relying on them? Does **one powerful server** matter more than individual users? 🤷‍♀️
2. **Can be overwhelming**: Constantly calculating happiness can be like having a dozen browser tabs open—your brain starts to slow down! Sometimes, it’s just easier to follow **ethical playbooks**.

### **🧠 Utilitarianism & Machine Learning: Can AI Be a Utilitarian?**

Picture a **self-driving car** trying to avoid hitting pedestrians while also keeping its passengers safe. 🤖🚘 It has to **weigh the consequences** for all involved—kind of like a robot using **utilitarianism**!

But there's a catch:

* How do you teach an AI what’s more valuable? Should it always avoid **hitting someone** at any cost? What if it has to make a **choice** between hitting one person vs. five people?

Utilitarianism sounds perfect for a robot, but it’s tricky because you need to **program the values** that it calculates—and as we learned, those values can be **hard to define**.

***

### **🎬 Story Time: "Message in a Bottle" by Nalo Hopkinson**

In **"Message in a Bottle,"** we follow Greg, who’s trying to figure out what’s most valuable as an artist. Just like in Utilitarianism, Greg faces challenges in figuring out what **value really means** and how to **share it fairly**.

**Takeaway**: **Utilitarianism** is like being a quest-giver in a game—you want everyone on your team to win, to have fun, and to level up together. In **cybersecurity**, it’s about protecting the most people, making decisions that maximize safety and happiness, and being the kind of defender that thinks about the big picture. 🌍🔐✨
