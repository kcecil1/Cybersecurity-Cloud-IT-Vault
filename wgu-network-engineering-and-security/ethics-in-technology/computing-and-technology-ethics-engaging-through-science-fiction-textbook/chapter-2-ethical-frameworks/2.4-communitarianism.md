# 2.4 COMMUNITARIANISM

Here's a fun, ADHD-friendly adventure into the land of **Communitarianism**! Let’s bring in vivid metaphors, gamified concepts, and plenty of direct connections to **cybersecurity** to make sure you nail those main ideas and ace the test. 🚀✨

***

### **🏘️ 2.4 Communitarianism: The Power of Community**

Imagine a world where **everything you do, every achievement you make, and every obstacle you overcome** isn't just about you—it’s about how your **community** supports you and grows with you. That’s the essence of **Communitarianism**!

It’s a philosophical approach that’s **all about the interdependence** we have with others. It's like you’re in an RPG game where your power doesn’t just come from leveling yourself up, but from your **guild’s strength** and your shared support systems! 🎮✨

* **Basic Assumption**: We **rely on each other**, not only for things like safety and shelter, but also for emotional and psychological well-being. Just like how a guild shares resources, **everyone benefits when the community thrives** (Masolo 2010; Smith-Morris 2020).

***

#### **🌟 2.4.1 Overview of Communitarianism: The Guild Comes First**

In Communitarianism, the **community comes before the individual**. Imagine your family, neighborhood, or even a **cybersecurity team**—these communities exist before we do, and they’re foundational in shaping who we become.

* **Self-Realization**: You **can't fully achieve your potential alone**. It’s like trying to complete a dungeon by yourself—it’s nearly impossible without the right team and support! You need the community for your journey of self-growth to be **meaningful and fulfilling** (Menkiti 1984; Gyekye 1997).
* **The Role of Elders**: Elders are like those legendary players in MMORPGs—they carry the **shared wisdom** of the community and **guide others** (Masolo 2010). In cybersecurity, this could be your experienced mentors, who pass on knowledge and ethical practices.

***

#### **🔗 How Communitarianism Connects to Cybersecurity**

In **cybersecurity**, the concept of **interdependence** is key:

1. **Threat Detection and Incident Response**: Imagine if every member of the security team operated **individually**, without coordinating with others. That would lead to chaos, right? Instead, the **SOC (Security Operations Center)** functions as a community where everyone **relies on each other** to spot threats and protect the organization.
2. **Shared Practices and Protocols**: The community sets the **standards** for what’s right or wrong (ethical hacking guidelines, data privacy laws, etc.). Without shared community ethics, cybersecurity practitioners would all be using **different tools, protocols, and practices**, which would make it super easy for attackers to exploit weaknesses.

***

#### **🔮 Sources of Communitarian Ethics: Where Did It Come From?**

The form of Communitarianism we're diving into today comes from **indigenous philosophy** and **lived community practices**—particularly in places like **sub-Saharan Africa**.

* **Colonial Impact**: Many traditional communities practiced forms of **communitarian living** before European colonization. Unfortunately, much of this **knowledge was violently suppressed** when European settlers arrived (Ani 2013; Biakolo 2003).
* **Not Just African**: Communitarian principles can be found **globally**, like in the **Catholic Worker Movement** in the USA and **kibbutzim** in Israel, which emphasize **shared living** and working together as a community (Sandel 2010; MacIntyre 2013).

***

#### **🌍 2.4.3 Person, Community, and World: Sub-Saharan Metaphysics**

The **sub-Saharan** worldview sees the world as a giant **interconnected system**—a massive multiplayer game where every living thing, from plants to people, is interconnected.

* **Death of Elders**: When a **community elder** dies, they don’t just “game over.” Instead, they become part of the collective community memory, guiding and inspiring new members like a **ghost mentor** in a video game (Menkiti 1984; Ramose 2003).
* **Interdependent Roles**: This means that **every individual’s role matters**, whether you’re the **frontline defender** or a **strategic analyst**. Each person is a vital element in the interconnected system.

***

#### **⚖️ Ubuntu: I Am Because We Are**

Ever heard of **Ubuntu**? It’s a Bantu term that means something like, **“I am because we are.”** It’s a powerful concept in southern and eastern African communities that emphasizes **human interdependence**.

* **Key Idea**: **No one succeeds alone**. When applied to **cybersecurity**, this is why sharing intelligence between organizations (like threat intelligence) is crucial. If one company learns about a **new cyber threat**, everyone else needs that knowledge to stay safe (Gade 2011; Mkhize 2008).

***

#### **🎓 Yorùbá Communitarianism: Listen to Learn**

**Yorùbá Communitarianism** in Western Africa has an interesting twist—it emphasizes **listening** over seeing when it comes to learning.

* **Hearing Over Seeing**: This means **learning is all about relationships** and **trust**. Just like in cybersecurity, information from a trusted source (a mentor, a colleague) is far more reliable than just randomly browsing Reddit or Twitter (Oyěwùmí 1997).
* **Firsthand vs. Secondhand Knowledge**: In cybersecurity, firsthand experience—like directly **witnessing an attack** or participating in a **pen test**—is extremely valuable. Secondhand knowledge (like reading about it) is still useful, but it's seen as different. **Trustworthy sources** are crucial for the community’s understanding of a threat.

***

#### **🏆 Self-Realization in Sub-Saharan Communitarianism**

The journey to **self-realization** in this context isn’t something you do alone. It’s more like being **boosted by your teammates** in a game—the community uplifts you and **validates your success**.

* **Claiming Social Roles**: Roles in the community—like **parent**, **mentor**, or **elder**—are important for defining one's personhood. This isn’t about biology but about **taking responsibility and giving back to others** (Masolo 2010).

***

#### **💬 Modalities for Judgment: Guiding Principles in Communitarianism**

Just like having guidelines in a **game** or protocols in cybersecurity, Communitarianism has principles to guide behavior:

1. **Consensus Principle**: Decisions are made by **finding common ground**. Imagine if you’re dealing with a **vulnerability disclosure**—you gather opinions from the team, align on how best to proceed, and **come to an agreement** together.
2. **Building Community**: Focuses on **nurturing ties** and creating bonds of trust. Think about making time for **knowledge-sharing** sessions or **mentoring** juniors—it’s all about making the community strong.
3. **Peace/Rehabilitation**: If someone makes a mistake, try to **repair the relationship** rather than cut them off. This is kind of like when an internal employee accidentally causes a **security breach**—instead of firing them, help them **learn** from the mistake to prevent future issues.

***

#### **🛠️ Application to Cybersecurity: Strengthening the Cyber Community**

* **Collective Defense**: Cybersecurity is all about **collaboration**. Whether it’s **incident response**, **threat intelligence sharing**, or **vulnerability reporting**, **the stronger the community**, the better it is for everyone involved.
* **Recognition & Roles**: Roles within a **SOC team** or **Red Team** aren’t just arbitrary. It’s about each person's **responsibility** to the others, and the role that they play in keeping the **digital space safe**.
* **Restorative Approach**: When there’s a **security incident**, the goal is to fix the issue and **restore trust**, not just punish those responsible. The **focus on rehabilitation** rather than punishment fits well in both the cybersecurity world and Communitarianism.
