# 6.3‚ÄÉCODES OF ETHICS

Alright! Let's use the **Pareto principle** to make this lesson on **codes of ethics** ADHD-friendly, focused, and fun‚Äîhighlighting the 20% that gives you 80% of the understanding. I‚Äôll keep it all tied back to **cybersecurity** for better context and relatability.

#### üöÄ CODES OF ETHICS IN TECH: CYBER EDITION üöÄ

**Main Points:**

* **Why Codes of Ethics Exist**: They set professional standards and guide behavior in tricky situations.
* **Key Ethics Bodies**: ACM, IEEE, and SECEPP each have their own codes, but share common values.
* **Core Principles**: Prioritizing the public good, honesty, avoiding harm, and transparency‚Äîthese guide decisions, especially in cybersecurity.

#### **6.3.1 The ACM and IEEE Codes: Core Values**

**What‚Äôs the deal with these codes?** They exist to make sure tech pros keep the **public good** in mind while balancing their own and their clients' interests. Let‚Äôs simplify this with the **20% of core values** that matter most in real-world situations.

1. **Prioritizing Public Good**
   * **Cybersecurity context**: Think of protecting user data. Just like a doctor has to prioritize patient safety, cybersecurity pros must prioritize **user safety**‚Äîe.g., disclosing vulnerabilities that could harm the public.
   * **ACM 1.1, IEEE 1, SECEPP 1.02**: All focus on **contributing to public welfare** and ensuring the work is beneficial to society.
2. **Avoiding Harm & Risk Disclosure**
   * If your software has a flaw, **disclose it**. This is super important in **cybersecurity**‚Äîimagine not reporting a vulnerability in a system that controls a dam or hospital equipment.
   * **ACM 1.2, IEEE 1, SECEPP 1.03**: ‚ÄúAvoid harm,‚Äù and always let people know if something could be dangerous.
3. **Honesty and Transparency**
   * **Honesty** isn't just about telling the truth‚Äîit‚Äôs also about not hiding things. This applies when presenting **penetration test results**: being transparent about risks and findings helps clients make better decisions.
   * **ACM 1.3, IEEE 4, SECEPP 1.06**: Be honest in all dealings, reject bribery, and avoid deceptive practices.
4. **Conflict of Interest**
   * If you work for a cybersecurity company and also hold shares in a vendor selling a security solution, disclose it! Hidden interests can compromise **trust**.
   * **ACM 1.3 elaboration, IEEE 2**: Be transparent about any conflict of interest‚Äîit‚Äôs crucial for maintaining professional integrity.
5. **Competency and Scope**
   * Stay within your lane! If you‚Äôre not trained in **forensic analysis**, don‚Äôt offer those services. This principle prevents unqualified individuals from causing harm.
   * **ACM 2.6, IEEE 6**: Only work in areas where you‚Äôre qualified‚Äîunderstanding your limits is key.

#### **6.3.2 Guidelines for Algorithms: Bias, Transparency, Accountability**

**ACM and IEEE** have also highlighted specific issues in **algorithmic decision-making**‚Äîimportant for cybersecurity as it increasingly involves **AI** and **machine learning**.

**The Key Principles**:

1. **Awareness of Bias**: Know that **algorithms** can be biased. This is crucial in cybersecurity, where biased algorithms can lead to **unfair flagging** or denying access to users from certain demographics.
2. **Accountability**: Always be accountable for the **decisions your system makes**‚Äîe.g., if an AI wrongly identifies someone as a threat, there should be human oversight.
3. **Transparency**: Provide explanations. If your system denies access or flags someone, the decision should be explainable, particularly when dealing with security threats.

#### **6.3.3 The Role and Function of Codes of Ethics**

**What are codes of ethics for?**

* They aren‚Äôt strict rules but **guidelines** to help professionals make decisions, especially when the answer isn‚Äôt black and white.
* **Cybersecurity Example**: In 2016, the FBI wanted Apple to break encryption for a terrorist's phone. Ethical principles like protecting privacy (ACM‚Äôs code) conflicted with potential public good (helping law enforcement). This is a classic case where codes of ethics provide guidance but not a definitive answer‚Äîprofessionals must balance multiple ethical considerations.

**Inward and Outward Facing Functions**:

* **Inward**: Remind professionals of shared values. Helps you, as a cybersecurity expert, decide how to act when pressured to take unethical shortcuts.
* **Outward**: Communicate to the **public** what professionals stand for, maintaining trust in fields like cybersecurity‚Äîwhere the stakes for misuse of data are very high.

#### **Story Point: ‚ÄúCodename: Delphi‚Äù** üö®

Imagine being **Karin**, a remote handler who gives real-time instructions to soldiers. Karin‚Äôs job is high stakes, requiring split-second decisions to keep people safe. This is much like a cybersecurity analyst under pressure during an active **DDoS attack**‚Äîmaking the right ethical call in seconds can make or break the safety of systems or even lives.

***

#### **KEY TAKEAWAYS (Pareto Principle Applied)**

1. **Public Good First**: Always think about how your actions impact the public‚Äîdata safety, vulnerability disclosure, etc.
2. **Avoid Harm**: If something could be harmful, disclose it (like reporting software vulnerabilities).
3. **Be Honest & Competent**: Stay transparent with clients and only do work within your expertise.
4. **Transparency in AI**: AI and algorithms need to be accountable and explainable‚Äîespecially when they impact people's security and rights.
