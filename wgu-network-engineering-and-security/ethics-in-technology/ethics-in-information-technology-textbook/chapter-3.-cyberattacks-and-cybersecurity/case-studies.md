#### The Lessons in a Nutshell: Fairplay & Sony Cybersecurity Cases

**1. Fairplay Turns to a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)**

* **Fairplay Finer Foods**, a Chicago-based grocery chain, faced growing security challenges as it expanded to multiple locations.
* Fairplay chose **ControlScan** as their MSSP for a **simple pricing model, skilled security experts, and advanced security technology**.
* ControlScan helped **install next-gen firewalls**, **monitor for security incidents**, and **support PCI DSS compliance** (which protects customer card data).
* The MSSP offered **cloud-based security services**, **network monitoring**, and **firewall installation**, allowing Fairplay to **outsource its cybersecurity** while focusing on its core business.

**Pareto Principle Takeaway**: Fairplay outsourced cybersecurity because they didn't need to be experts in IT security. Using **an MSSP saved Fairplay from spending 80% of their time managing IT while still getting 80% of the benefit of strong security.** It allowed them to focus on the most important 20%—running their grocery stores.

**Cybersecurity Lesson for You**:

* **Outsource what you can**. Companies without in-house IT expertise may benefit more from **partnering with an MSSP** to manage evolving security threats and stay compliant with regulations.
* While MSSPs are convenient, **don’t blindly trust them**—ensure you understand what's being done to secure your data.

**Applications in Cybersecurity**:

* **PCI DSS Compliance**: MSSPs help with regulatory compliance for payment systems—**keeping customer data secure and preventing costly breaches**.
* **Firewalls & Monitoring**: They help **identify threats** in real time, giving companies an edge in **responding quickly** to incidents.

**2. Sony's Cyber Nightmare with North Korea**

* In **2014**, hackers from **North Korea** (the "Guardians of Peace") breached **Sony Pictures**, stealing sensitive data like **Social Security numbers, financial info, passwords, and even unreleased movies**.
* Sony was hacked because of their movie **"The Interview,"** which mocked North Korea's leader, **Kim Jong-un**. The North Koreans wanted to force Sony to cancel the film’s release.
* The **FBI and NSA** were involved, with the U.S. tracing the attack back to North Korea using digital clues left behind.
* The hack **shut down Sony’s systems** and damaged 75% of their servers.
* After pressure, **Sony canceled the release** of "The Interview," but then made it available online and generated **$40 million in revenue** despite the chaos.
* President **Obama publicly criticized Sony**, saying, “We cannot let some dictator impose censorship in the U.S.”

**Pareto Principle Takeaway**: The **20% action** that made the most difference? **Restoring public confidence and making the film available digitally**, which showed that Sony wouldn’t back down completely from a cyber threat.

**Cybersecurity Lesson for You**:

* **Resilience matters**. Organizations should have a plan in place to **restore operations** and **maintain public confidence**.
* **Monitor your network for intruders** and **prepare response plans**. Knowing what to do when an attack happens is essential.
* Don’t overlook **reputation management**—public perception can impact how well you recover from a breach.

**Applications in Cybersecurity**:

* **Threat Response**: Having **response plans** and **quick actions** helps regain control when a breach happens.
* **Public Communication**: It's essential to **manage communication with the public** to maintain trust after a security breach.
* **Data Monitoring & NSA Tools**: Be aware of how agencies can use digital footprints to trace back attacks—**digital monitoring can expose vulnerabilities**.
