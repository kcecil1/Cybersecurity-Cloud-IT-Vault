#### **Cyberattack Response: The 20% of Key Steps for Handling the Worst**

When it comes to cybersecurity, it’s not **if** you get attacked but **when**. Here’s a streamlined response plan—distilled to give you the **essence of a good incident response**:

**1. Plan Ahead Before an Attack Hits**

* **Have a Response Plan**: Don’t wait until after a hack—develop a response plan in advance! It should be approved by **senior management and legal teams**.
* **Key Concept**: Being **prepared** helps keep the incident **under control**, both technically and emotionally.

> **Cybersecurity Impact**: Planning ahead reduces the chaos when attackers strike, giving you a clear course of action.

#### **Key Steps for Responding to an Attack**

**2. Incident Notification**

* **Who Gets Notified?**: Know who to contact—internally and externally—when a breach happens.
* **Discretion is Key**: Don’t spill all the beans in public spaces; attackers could be listening.
* **Ethics Matter**: It’s tempting to hide data breaches from customers, but **ethical and legal obligations** often require disclosure.

> **Pareto Focus**: Properly notifying relevant parties and **keeping a tight communication circle** covers 80% of controlling the situation.

**3. Protect Evidence and Logs**

* **Document Everything**: Keep a detailed log of everything done during the incident—actions, communications, system events. This can serve as **evidence for legal action** later.
* **Legal Handling**: Work with the legal team to follow proper procedures—data needs to be preserved correctly if you want it to hold up in court.

> **Cybersecurity Impact**: Without proper documentation, you lose out on both **legal protection** and **lessons learned** from the incident.

**4. Incident Containment**

* **Act Fast**: Quickly contain the attack to prevent more damage—decide if critical systems should be shut down.
* **Plan the Decision Process**: Know **who makes these decisions** and **how fast** they must be made.

> **Pareto Insight**: Making the right containment decisions covers **80% of stopping further damage** in a security incident.

**5. Eradication**

* **Clean It Up**: After collecting evidence, start eradicating the threat—make backups, clean malware, and ensure a complete restoration.
* **Keep Backups Ready**: It’s crucial to have frequent backups so data can be restored.

> **Key Focus**: Frequent backups are the **20% effort** that ensures **80% success** in data recovery post-incident.

**6. Incident Follow-Up**

* **Learn and Adapt**: Write an **incident report** that covers what happened, why, and how to prevent it from happening again.
* **Ask Tough Questions**: Could a simple patch have prevented the attack? Why wasn’t it installed?

> **Cybersecurity Impact**: Proper follow-up ensures the same mistakes aren’t repeated, which is crucial for **long-term resilience**.

***

#### **Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs)**

* **When You Need Extra Help**: If your organization can’t keep up with cyber threats, hire an **MSSP** to handle it. They manage network security, monitor threats, and provide critical services.
* **Key Players**: Companies like **AT\&T, IBM, Dell SecureWorks**, etc., offer MSSP services.

> **Pareto Value**: For many organizations, **20% of investment in an MSSP** can provide **80% of needed security services**, especially when internal resources are limited.

***

#### **Computer Forensics: Catching the Bad Guys**

* **What Is Computer Forensics?**: It’s all about **gathering digital evidence** after an attack—collecting data in a way that is acceptable in court.
* **Specialized Tools and Certifications**: Forensic investigators use tools like **Forensic Toolkit** and have certifications such as **CISSP, GCFA**.

> **Pareto Approach**: Properly preserving digital evidence ensures **80% of success** in prosecuting cybercriminals.

***

#### **Key Takeaways for Cybersecurity**

* **Plan Ahead**: Always have a response plan—this is the **20% effort** that gives you **80% readiness**.
* **Incident Response is All About Control**: Containing the attack and logging actions are critical to managing the situation.
* **Ethics and Communication**: Be transparent with customers where needed—being ethical pays off in the long run.
* **MSSPs and Forensics**: Outsource and investigate when internal resources are limited; these help in securing and handling incidents efficiently.
