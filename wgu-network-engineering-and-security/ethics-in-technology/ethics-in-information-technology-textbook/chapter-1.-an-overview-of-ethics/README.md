# Chapter 1. An Overview of Ethics

Let's dive into **"Organizations Behaving Badly"** with a focus on key concepts, cybersecurity connections, and keeping things engaging.

#### 🚨 **The Tale of "Cramming" and Sneaky Charges** 🚨

Imagine you're playing detective on your monthly phone bill. Suddenly, _bam!_ You notice mysterious charges for services like horoscope texts or wallpapers. You think, "Wait, I didn’t sign up for this!" Welcome to the wild world of **cramming**—a shady practice where companies sneak unauthorized charges into your bill.

#### 🕵️‍♀️ **Key Events & Concepts** 🕵️‍♂️

* **Cramming Defined**: Adding unauthorized, recurring third-party charges to consumers' bills.
  * Example: Charges up to **$9.99/month** for "premium" subscriptions like ringtones or text messages.
* **FCC vs. AT\&T Mobility (October 2014)**:
  * **Fine**: $105 million settlement for unauthorized charges.
  * Customers were **tricked** into subscriptions and couldn’t easily spot these charges.
  * Refunds? AT\&T only gave back **partial refunds**.
* **Data Throttling (2015)**:
  * **FCC Fine**: Another **$100 million** for misleading "unlimited data" plan users.
  * What happened? After using a certain amount of data, AT\&T slowed down speeds, but users were still charged for full service.
* Other Companies Behaving Badly:
  * **T-Mobile USA**: Fined **$90 million** for ignoring customer complaints about cramming.
  * **Verizon**: Fined **$90 million**.
  * **Sprint**: Fined **$68 million**.

#### 🔍 **Cybersecurity Connections**

Now let’s tie this to the world of cybersecurity! Here’s what you can learn and apply:

1. **Threat Actor Techniques**:
   * Just like cramming relies on **hidden charges**, cybercriminals often exploit **hidden vulnerabilities**. For example:
     * **Phishing**: Tricking users into subscribing to malicious services.
     * **Malware**: Dropping unauthorized software onto devices.
2. **Billing Data Security**:
   * Weaknesses in billing systems allow exploitation.
   * **Cybersecurity Priority**: Secure APIs, encrypt billing data, and implement **strong authentication** for payment systems.
3. **Ethical Hacking Applications**:
   * **Penetration Testing**: Test billing systems for vulnerabilities that could allow unauthorized access or tampering.
   * **AI for Threat Detection**: Use AI to detect unusual billing patterns (e.g., repeated $9.99 charges).
4. **Digital Forensics**:
   * Analyze billing system logs to identify fraudulent activities and trace attackers.

#### ✨ **ADHD-Friendly Fun Facts** ✨

* The FCC didn’t play around in **2014 and 2015**! They dished out **millions** in fines.
* Think of cramming like a sneaky pop-up ad that steals your money.
* **Unlimited Data Lie**: A modern twist on “too good to be true.”

#### 🎯 **Test/Exam Pointers** 🎯

* **Key Term**: **Cramming** = unauthorized charges on bills.
* **Important Date**: **October 2014**: $105 million FCC fine against AT\&T.
* **People**: FCC (Federal Communications Commission) led these investigations.
