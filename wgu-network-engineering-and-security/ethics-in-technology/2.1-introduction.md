* How do **laws** and **societal responsibilities** play into ethical decisions?

#### **Cybersecurity Connection:**

In cybersecurity, we constantly face ethical dilemmas:

* Should we prioritize **user privacy** or **national security**?
* Is it ethical to use offensive tactics to defend against cyber threats?
* How do we handle personal data responsibly?

### **🌌 Metaphysical Presuppositions: The Big Picture**

#### **Definition:**

* **Metaphysics**: Our understanding of reality and existence.

#### **Influence on Ethics:**

* Shapes how we perceive ethical issues.
* Affects our judgments and decisions.

#### **In Cybersecurity:**

* Beliefs about the nature of technology and human behavior influence policies and practices.

***

### **🚫 Limitations of Frameworks**

* **No Universal Solution**: Each framework has its strengths and weaknesses.
* **Cultural Biases**: Frameworks may reflect specific cultural or historical contexts.

#### **Important Names to Remember:**

* **Alasdair MacIntyre (2013)**: Critiqued the idea of applying ethical theories universally.
* **Victoria Clarke (2010)**: Discussed how disagreements reveal our values.
* **Oyeronke Oyěwùmí (1997)**: Highlighted cultural limitations in ethical perspectives.
