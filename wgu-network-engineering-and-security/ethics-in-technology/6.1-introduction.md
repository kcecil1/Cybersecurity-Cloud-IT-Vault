#### ðŸš€ PROFESSIONAL ETHICS: CYBER EDITION ðŸš€

**Learning Objectives**

1. **Traits of a Profession**: Learn what makes a tech job "professional."
2. **Ethical Responsibility**: Understand why it's shared by individuals and the profession.
3. **Code of Ethics**: Use it to make decisions, and understand its limits.
4. **Ethical Toolkit**: Apply frameworks like moral imagination to real problems.

#### **Introduction: Ethics in Cybersecurity**

**Professional ethics** are a guide for tech workers, setting higher standards because of the **public trust** they handle. Unlike "cashier ethics," cybersecurity ethics are formalized due to the **critical impact** on society. Imagine being a cybersecurity expert at a power grid: the stakes are much higher than a regular job, so ethics guide us through decisions.

**ABET**, a key accreditor for computer science in the U.S., **requires** professional ethics trainingâ€”emphasizing the importance of learning these principles in tech careers.

#### **Traits of a Profession**

A **profession** includes:

1. **Specialized Knowledge**: Cybersecurity expertise (e.g., defending against **phishing**).
2. **Public Trust**: People trust pros to safeguard **critical infrastructure**.
3. **Code of Ethics**: Guidelines like **ACM Code of Ethics** help maintain ethical behavior.
4. **Commitment to Good**: Protecting systems is about **public safety**, not just business.

#### **Shared Ethical Responsibility**

The debate: Should ethical responsibility rest on the **individual** or the **profession**?

* **Advantages of professional codes**: Standards create consistency (like a unified **playbook**).
* **Disadvantages**: Over-reliance on the rules without context.

In cybersecurity, the **professional** standard helps when individuals might miss bigger consequencesâ€”like deciding to disclose a **zero-day vulnerability**.

#### **Codes of Ethics: GPS for Cybersecurity Decisions**

**Codes of ethics** (like ACM) guide decision-making but have limitsâ€”e.g., deciding on reporting **spyware** on a VIP's device. They don't cover every situation (e.g., novel **AI threats**). You need ethical **frameworks** like:

* **Utilitarianism** (maximize good).
* **Deontology** (follow rules).

***

#### **Your Ethical Toolkit**

1. **Professional Codes** (e.g., **IEEE**).
2. **Institutional Processes** (e.g., vulnerability reporting).
3. **Ethical Frameworks**: Utilitarianism, deontology, **virtue ethics**.
4. **Moral Imagination**: Think creatively about consequences. Imagine how hackers might misuse your system and prevent it.

**Example**: You discover a **backdoor** in a bank's system:

* Report it (code of ethics).
* Think of consequences if not patched (moral imagination).

***

#### **Cybersecurity Ethics Summary**

* Professions involve **trust and high responsibility**.
* **Ethical codes** and shared responsibility guide tech pros in impactful decisions.
* Use an **ethical toolkit** to navigate what codes might not cover.
