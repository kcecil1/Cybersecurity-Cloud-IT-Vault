#### Command Prompt vs. PowerShell: The Ultimate Showdown! ⚔️💻

Let’s break down the key differences between **Command Prompt** (the OG) and **PowerShell** (the newer, cooler kid on the block). Spoiler: PowerShell is like CMD’s way more talented cousin. 🙃

***

#### **Key Comparison Table**

| **Feature**               | **PowerShell** 🛠️                                       | **Command Prompt** 📜                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Introduced**            | 2006 (fresh and modern-ish)                              | 1981 (old but gold)                        |
| **Commands Supported**    | Runs batch commands _and_ PowerShell cmdlets             | Only runs batch commands                   |
| **Aliases**               | Supports command aliases (shortcuts, yay!)               | No aliases allowed 😢                      |
| **Piping Output**         | Cmdlet output can be passed to other cmdlets (teamwork!) | Outputs can’t work together—sad solo vibes |
| **Output Type**           | All output is an object (fancy and versatile)            | Outputs are plain text (simple and static) |
| **Execution Style**       | Runs cmdlets in sequence via scripts                     | Commands run one at a time (slow grind)    |
| **Scripting Environment** | Has an Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE)            | Nope, none of that scripting luxury        |
| **Programming Libraries** | Built on .NET framework, so it’s library-rich 📚         | No library access, sorry!                  |
| **Cross-Platform**        | Works on Linux systems too! 🐧                           | Stuck on Windows forever 🖼️               |

#### **TL;DR: Why Care?**

* **Command Prompt**: Great for quick, basic tasks. Reliable, but very limited.
* **PowerShell**: A scripting powerhouse that can do _everything_ CMD can do and so much more. It’s the multitool you want for complex tasks, automation, and advanced system administration.

PowerShell is the obvious winner if you need versatility and power. CMD, while trusty, feels like typing on a typewriter in a world of laptops. Which one will you choose to conquer your next challenge? 👑
