# Dancing with Protocols: SMB Reconnaissance and Guest Access

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The answer is "Server Message Block"

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I will attempt to use NMAP to just scan the IP address of the target, since these easy machines typically will tell / show me what port is being used for the protocol they want me to learn.

Hmmm... I'm not really sure what I'm looking at here... I will have to investigate further by asking AI what all the output means.

Here's a simple breakdown of the Nmap scan output you've provided:

1. Scan Command: nmap -sC -sV 10.129.199.54 - This command tells Nmap to scan the IP address 10.129.199.54 with default scripts (-sC) and attempt to detect service versions (-sV).
2. Host Information:
   * Host is up: The target machine is active and responded to the scan.
   * Latency: The time it took for the host to respond was 0.067 seconds.
3. Ports and Services:
   * 135/tcp: Open and running msrpc (Microsoft Remote Procedure Call), which is used for communication between Windows processes.
   * 139/tcp: Open for netbios-ssn, which is part of the NetBIOS over TCP/IP protocol suite, used for file and printer sharing services in Windows.
   * 445/tcp: Open and likely running microsoft-ds (Microsoft Directory Services), commonly used for Windows file sharing and Active Directory.
4. Service Detection:
   * Operating System: The services detected suggest this is a Windows operating system. The notation cpe:/o:microsoft:windows indicates a Common Platform Enumeration for a version of Microsoft Windows.
5. Host Script Results:
   * smb2-time: Shows the current date and time as reported by the SMB (Server Message Block) service on the target, which is 2024-12-31T08:55:52. There's no start date available, which might be due to the configuration or policy settings on the SMB service.
   * smb2-security-mode: Indicates the security settings for SMB version 2. It mentions that message signing is enabled but not required, which is a security feature to ensure the integrity of the communication.
6. Clock Skew: There's a discrepancy of about 4 hours between your computer's time and the target's reported time, suggesting that the target's clock might be set incorrectly or there could be a timezone difference.
7. Service Detection and Reporting: Nmap encourages users to report any inaccuracies in service detection to help improve its database.
8. Scan Summary:
   * The scan took about 19.92 seconds to complete and scanned one IP address.

\
This output provides a snapshot of the network services available on the target machine, its operating... I guess Grok gave up at that point.

That didn't really give me any conclusive information about what port smb operates at... I'd assume that it operates at one of the open ports scanned by nmap though... either 135 msrpc, 139 netbios-ssn or 445 microsoft-ds?\
\
So I asked Grok specifically:

Here is the AI's output:\
SMB (Server Message Block) primarily uses port 445. Here's a breakdown of the ports mentioned:

* Port 135: This port is used by Microsoft RPC (Remote Procedure Call) services, which can facilitate SMB communication but isn't directly used for SMB file sharing itself. RPC is a protocol that allows one program to request a service from a program on another computer without having to understand the network's details.
* Port 139: This port is associated with NetBIOS Session Service, which was used by earlier versions of SMB (SMB 1.0) over NetBIOS. This setup allowed for file and printer sharing in Windows environments but has largely been deprecated in favor of direct SMB over TCP/IP on port 445.
* Port 445: This is the primary port used by SMB for file sharing, printer sharing, and other services in modern Windows networks. SMB uses this port to operate over TCP/IP directly without needing NetBIOS.

\
So, while ports 135 and 139 might be related to services that interact with SMB or older versions of it, port 445 is where you'll find SMB in action for file sharing and related network services in current Windows environments.

Alright so it's port 445.

Task 3's answer was already revealed by the nmap scan:

For the following task 4 I attempted to answer with the command "ls" but that was incorrect. I shamelessly selected the hint icon, which told me to attempt using the 'man smbclient' command to bring up the list of commands to find it myself:

The answer ended up being "-L"

The next task, task 5 is asking me how many shares are there on the Dancing lab... I have absolutely no idea. Guess it's time to ask AI again.
