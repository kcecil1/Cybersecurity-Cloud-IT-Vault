Target Machine IP address:

10.129.194.201



Task 1

How many TCP ports are open on the machine?

\*

I'm going to guess less than 10.

I pinged the target IP address to make sure I had connection. I first attempted to run the following command "nmap -p- 10.129.194.201" but then canceled the command from running by hitting crtl C because I realized I might want to run the switches -sV for service version and -sC for default scripts, so I ran "nmap -sV -sC -p- 10.129.194.201" ... But the output ended up being too large so I reran the command this time without the default script switch "-sC" to shorten up that output.

Looks like two ports are open, ports 22 for ssh and 27017 for mongodb

The answer I submitted was correct for "2"



Task 2

Which service is running on port 27017 of the remote host?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*.\*.8\


The answer to task two is in the output for the nmap scan:

The answer to task 2 should be "MongoDB 3.6.8"

The answer was correct when I submitted it.



Task 3

What type of database is MongoDB? (Choose: SQL or NoSQL)

\*\*\*\*L\


The answer to task 3 should be "NoSQL"

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (171).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The answer submitted was correct.



Task 4

What is the command name for the Mongo shell that is installed with the mongodb-clients package?

\*\*\*\*\*\*h



I have no idea what the answer to this task is, so I will check the writeup.

The writeup told me install the "mongosh" tool for interfacing with the mongodb so that seems to be the answer:\

The answer mongosh was correct when submitted to task 4.



Task 5

What is the command used for listing all the databases present on the MongoDB server? (No need to include a trailing ;)

\*\*\*\* \*\*s\


The answer to task 5 is "show dbs"

Task 7

What is the command used for dumping the content of all the documents within the collection named flag in a format that is easy to read?

\*\*.\*\*\*\*.\*\*\*\*().\*\*\*\*\*\*()\


The answer to task 7 is "db.flag.find().pretty();"
